// Agents: agents that are plugins from the start. A plugin registers an agent
// type (its summary line, peek view, settings tabs and `run`); each agent made
// from it has its own native-held key, an `agent-attention/v1` configuration the
// app owns and the agent edits through its handle, and a config blob the type
// owns. The app delivers matching live events to
// `run` from the stream the owner already receives in the agent's community,
// selected or not, so no plugin opens a socket or a REQ.
//
// A hosted type's provider holds the key and runs the agent instead. The app
// creates it through the type's `remote` steps and signs only the owner's
// attestation. Every agent of either kind is listed in the owner's kind 30177
// records with its type as the `runtime` tag, so every device of the owner's
// can show it: as here, hosted, or on another device.
