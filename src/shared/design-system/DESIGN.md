# Design guide

## Start here when building a screen

This guide applies to all Buzz UI, including feature pages and bundled plugins.
Start with the screen's structure, then choose components, then their tokens.
Matching colors alone does not make a screen consistent. Existing app code can
contain adoption gaps; it is not automatically an approved design example.

1. Identify the surface and what its host already supplies. For plugins, start
   with [contribution boundaries](#plugin-contribution-boundaries).
2. Choose the shared composition below. Inspect its implementation and a current
   caller; keep navigation, data, and persistence with their existing owners.
3. Read the linked rules for the affected controls and states. Reuse their recipes
   instead of overriding appearance in feature CSS.
4. Check the rendered screen, including loading, empty, error, and populated states.
   Report any checks you did not perform. Follow the root contribution workflow
   for iteration; a token-check pass is not a visual review.

| What you are building | Use | Keep out of this role |
| --- | --- | --- |
| A workspace pane or full-page destination | `PanelHeader` with the [panel header recipe](#panel-headers) | A large page heading in place of pane chrome |
| Static pane identity | `PanelHeaderLabel` in the header's `title` slot | A bare title string or a custom icon/title flex row in new compositions |
| Existing tabbed pane navigation | `Tabs variant="navigation"` in that slot | New tab semantics for a static title or route destination |
| Actions at the trailing edge of pane chrome | Small, ghost `IconButton`s; shared Menu for overflow | Text buttons, forms, filters, or a primary call-to-action banner |
| Content introduction within a pane, such as a Settings page | `Header` | A second copy of the pane title with no additional purpose |
| A compact sidebar or settings navigation | `SidebarNavigation` with NavigationSection / NavigationItem | Feature-owned row repaint, duplicate scrollports, or a new panel frame |
| A named content group | `InlineHeader`; Settings groups use `SettingsGroup` | Another panel header or an arbitrary large heading |
| A modal | `Dialog` / `AlertDialog` and their title, body, and action slots | Panel chrome or generic headings replacing dialog labelling |
| Empty collection or setup state | `EmptyState` with a useful next action | Hiding the pane header, or calling a loading/error state empty |
| A list, directory, or master/detail workspace | [Collection layout](#collections-and-workspaces) | A new card style for each feature or a filter inside pane chrome |
| An object opened beside the current task | [Detail panel](#detail-panels) within the existing panel host | A second dock, duplicate close button, or nested outer frame |
| Preferences, account configuration, or plugin setup | [Settings composition](#settings-pages-and-contributions) | A dashboard layout or a custom row/control recipe |
| A form, confirmation, catalog, or inspector that blocks the task | [Dialog composition](#modal-composition) | A hand-built modal shell or an unrelated pane-header rule |
| Actions, a short anchored form, or a field choice | [Anchored surfaces](#menus-popovers-and-pickers) | Interchanging Menu, Popover, and Select just because they look similar |

Component sources live in [`ui/`](ui/). Use the
[adoption map](../../../docs/design-system-adoption.md) for feature ownership and
[appearance and settings guidance](../../../docs/design-system.md) for host integration.
For details, consult [Controls](#controls), [Form composition](#form-composition),
[Surface and depth](#surface-and-depth), [row alignment](#align-row-content-not-state-backgrounds),
[Writing](#writing), and [Responsiveness](#responsiveness).

Adopted rules describe the target, even where callers have not migrated yet.
Sections explicitly marked **proposed** are not permission for a broad rollout.
Keep documented exceptions local to their stated use. If the requested design
needs a new exception or shared variant, explain the gap before expanding scope;
do not infer approval from an existing inconsistent screen.

## Compose the whole surface

Use these recipes before the detailed visual reference below. They describe
structure and ownership, not new plugin APIs. Examples demonstrate the named
pattern only; the [adoption review](../../../docs/design-system-adoption.md#composition-review)
records known gaps so callers are not mistaken for complete design approval.

### Collections and workspaces

Arrange a full view in this order: pane identity and global icon actions; optional
search/filter controls; scoped status or recovery; the collection or working area.
Put filters beside the collection they affect, with one clear reading order. A
filter does not belong in the pane's icon-action slot. Resetting a filter must be
possible when the results are empty.

Use rows for objects people scan and compare. Use cards when an item's preview or
grouped content earns the extra area; a grid is not the default for every directory.
Reuse the shared row/control appropriate to the interaction, with a consistent
leading icon/avatar slot, primary label, supporting text, and trailing metadata
or actions. Keep an independent row action outside the row's primary click target.
Do not make decorative metadata look like another control.

Use `FullPageSurface` for one page surface, or the existing workspace owner for
multiple regions. FullPageSurface supplies the surface, not padding or scrolling.
Give each independently scrolling region one intentional scrollport; fix toolbars
and composers outside it when they must remain available. Let flex/grid children
shrink before adding overflow. Do not nest an additional scrollport around an
already bounded list, timeline, editor, or terminal.

Master/detail layouts preserve list selection, scroll, and drafts while inspecting
an item. Follow the existing host's narrow overlay/navigation behavior rather than
squeezing two unusable columns into a small viewport. Selection, hover, and focus
remain distinct. Shared tabs connect related views of one object; route destinations
retain navigation semantics except for the wide shell topbar described in
[Chrome route navigation](#chrome-route-navigation). When replacing a focused page heading with shared
chrome, preserve a meaningful destination focus target, such as a named content
region. Do not add a duplicate title or discard the focus handoff just because the
shared heading has no ref or tabIndex prop. [Inbox](../../bundled/inbox/InboxPage.tsx) demonstrates
body filters and list/detail ownership; [Solo chats](../../bundled/channels/ChannelsPage.tsx)
demonstrates a working area with a persistent composer. Neither is a blanket visual
template: check the adoption review before copying their surrounding chrome.

### Detail panels

First inspect the mounting host. `PanelCard` and `PanelWorkspace` can already supply
the surface, identity, close action, and tabs. A contributed body supplies object
content, local controls, and its states; it must not repeat those outer elements.
Keep object summary before detailed sections. Use panel-style tabs for related
content on the opaque surface; do not use backdrop/chrome tabs inside it.

Use the existing panel navigation/subview mechanism for related details. Preserve
the original panel's scroll and draft state, the host's close/back behavior, and
focus restoration. Do not create another overlay, navigation history, or global
panel selection to show a local detail. Profile content in
[`ProfilePanel`](../../bundled/profiles/ProfilePanel.tsx) and the
[`PanelSubview`](../../features/panels/PanelSubview.tsx) host show this boundary.
Media, diffs, browser content, and terminals retain their renderer-owned geometry
and input semantics; shared framing does not turn them into padded forms.

### Settings pages and contributions

Settings is a reading/form column inside host-owned navigation. Reuse its centered
48rem maximum column, shared insets, and responsive behavior; do not add a second
page surface, sidebar, fixed viewport width, or nested settings scroll container.
A Settings destination starts with `Header`, then named groups with `InlineHeader`.
Align headings with their groups' content, not just their outer borders.

Choose the group by how it behaves:

| Behavior | Composition | Actions and feedback |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Immediate preference | `SettingsGroup` with `PreferenceRow` / `SwitchPreferenceRow` | Control at the trailing edge; pending/error beside that setting; no unrelated Save button |
| Draft that needs explicit save | `SettingsGroup layout="form"` with shared labelled fields | Secondary action then primary Save in a wrapping action row; preserve draft, validation, and save gates |
| Manage connected objects or integrations | `InlineHeader` plus rows/list and contextual actions | Keep connection, permission, recovery, and destructive actions attached to the object they affect |
| Active connection or stepped setup | `Header`, `SettingsGroup layout="form"`, shared labelled fields, and the existing step owner | Preserve immediate setup actions and recovery; do not invent a Save step or replace the active flow with EmptyState |
| Setup or settled empty collection | `EmptyState` | Explain what belongs here and provide the available next step; do not wrap it in another SettingsGroup |

Keep group headings outside SettingsGroup, and use the documented field/section
gaps rather than each plugin inventing its own rhythm. Dependent preferences retain
the row's alignment. A row is not an extra click target around its input. Preserve
visible labels and connect help/error text; placeholders cannot replace labels.
Use `Accordion` for optional details, retaining mounted draft input where needed.
Use `Accordion variant="settings"` for disclosures alongside preference rows.
Its full-row trigger uses the settings container shape and spacing; the chevron
is decorative, and the entire row expands the content. `Select variant="preference"` uses the same
label and compact choice control without adding a group container.
See [settings fills and spacing](../../../docs/design-system.md#content-headers-and-settings-fills).
[`NotificationSettings`](../../app/NotificationSettings.tsx) illustrates immediate
preferences; [`ProfileSettings`](../../app/ProfileSettings.tsx) illustrates an
explicit-save form. Their save behavior is not interchangeable.

### Modal composition

A modal interrupts the current task to complete a bounded task. Use the shared
`Dialog` for forms, editors, catalogs, and inspectors; use `AlertDialog` for a
standalone consequential confirmation. “Modal” is the interaction mode, not another
component to build. Preserve established stepped confirmations and their dismissal
policy rather than silently changing semantics during visual adoption.

Compose title and optional useful description together in the shared header
heading, with Close aligned beside them. This lockup applies to both `Dialog`
and `AlertDialog`; descriptions are not separate body paragraphs. Follow with
optional task content, then actions. Without task content, use the shared inset
as the gap between the header and actions. Pass introductory copy through `description` and
omit `children` when there is no task body; do not add an empty wrapper. Keep field
help, status, warnings, and section-specific explanations with their content.
Ordinary flow Dialogs use sticky header and footer bars over the scrolling body.
Their full backgrounds combine a surface-color gradient and progressive blur;
labels and actions remain sharp. Reduced transparency uses an opaque surface.
`ScrollEdgeMaterial` owns this treatment, shared with the agent Save footer.
Its host supplies overlap and isolation; `--scroll-edge-surface` selects the
host surface when it differs from the default popover surface.
`--scroll-edge-fill` can supply a stronger backing behind text within that fade.
Navigated, stepped, stable-height, and internally scrolling dialogs retain their
existing layout.

Put the completion action in the `actions` footer, with Cancel/Close before it. Keep other
task controls in the body; reserve `headerActions` for contextual utilities beside
the shared Close control. The pane-header icon-only rule does not prohibit text
buttons in dialog footers, forms, or menus. Do not recreate the backdrop, title,
close button, body padding, or footer with feature-specific markup.

For an illustrated introduction, `artwork` places feature-owned imagery above a
centered title and description, keeping shared Close at the top right. Keep the
artwork bounded and leave room beside its top edge for Close. Community import
uses this slot for the agent portrait and its overlapping community images.

| Task | Shared starting point | Scrolling |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Short form or confirmation | `size="compact"` Dialog, or AlertDialog for confirmation | Dialog body scrolls with title/actions visible; AlertDialog retains its bounded flow |
| Searchable list or changing catalog | `height="stable"`; `bodyLayout="flex"` when filters stay fixed | Fixed controls above one flexing results scrollport |
| Two-column catalog | `size="wide"` | Bound both content and viewport; preserve a usable narrow arrangement |
| Large diff or reading surface | `size="expanded"` | Content scrolls while title and Close stay available |
| Settings or another sectioned modal | `navigation={{ label, content }}` | Shared flush sidebar and detail scrollports; stacked navigation at narrow widths |
| Side inspector that must be modal | `placement="right"` | Same modal labelling, focus, and dismissal contracts |

Dialogs and modals share a `2rem` inset, reduced to `1rem` at viewport widths
of `30rem` or less, and a secondary (`subtle`) Close button. The responsive inset
applies to headers, bodies, actions, and navigation panes; search keeps its
documented field framing.
Use `size="compact"` for a short form or confirmation: a centered `25rem` maximum
width. Standard modals use `40rem`, wide modals `55rem`, and expanded modals `72rem`.
Modals start `8rem` from the viewport top, with a `1rem` bottom/side gutter and
viewport-capped scrolling. Below `40rem` viewport height, the top gutter becomes
`1rem` so actions remain reachable, including with enlarged text.
Expanded modals support tables, two-column content, or integrated navigation.
When a short window or enlarged text leaves too little room below navigation
chrome, the whole modal scrolls while retaining at least one control-height pane
inside its insets. Navigation headers use `space-4` vertically and the shared
dialog inset horizontally; each pane retains that inset. List rows retain their
shared padding and align through the existing wrapper offset. Host-contained
sectioned modals center within their host, capped at 72rem wide and 48rem tall,
with a `space-4` gutter. At viewport widths up to 30rem they fill the host to
preserve usable space with enlarged text. Their panes scroll within that surface.

Surface and contents enter together with a `0.75rem` upward fade over
`duration-settle` (`220ms`) and `easing-enter`. Exit moves only `0.25rem` and uses
`duration-fast` (`120ms`). The settled surface has no animation transform.
Keyboard, reduced-motion and `motion="none"` stay immediate. Base UI owns
transition presence, focus and dismissal. Search retains its documented compact
field framing but shares modal placement and motion. Right-side inspectors and
host-contained surfaces retain their established placement; fullscreen media
retains renderer-owned geometry.

These are starting choices, not permission to combine every option. Default to
content height; reserve stable height when changing results would otherwise make
the task jump. Proposed `height="stable-tall"` reserves up to 44rem for agent
creation and its avatar catalog, with the same viewport cap and scrolling as
`stable`. Do not hardcode a screen-sized modal or add header/body gaps on top
of the shared padding. [`ChannelMembersDialog`](../../bundled/channels/ChannelMembersDialog.tsx)
shows bounded search/results; [`RemindDialog`](../../bundled/reminders/RemindDialog.tsx)
shows a short form; [`DiffMessage`](../../bundled/diffs/DiffMessage.tsx) shows expanded
reading. See [dialog behavior and geometry](#dialogs-and-supporting-compositions).

Ordinary Dialogs dismiss on outside click by default. Use
`dismissOnOutsideClick={false}` for an explicitly protected workflow; `preventClose`
blocks outside click, Escape and Close while an operation cannot be abandoned.
AlertDialog confirmations retain deliberate Cancel/confirm dismissal, never an
outside-click shortcut. Every shared modal forwards backdrop presses over an
empty desktop titlebar to the host’s native window-drag behavior only after a
held mouse moves beyond the shared gesture threshold. A stationary click there
remains an outside dismissal; actual dragging keeps the modal open without enabling
blocked controls underneath. The host owns
platform APIs and exact drag-region hit testing, not the design system.

AlertDialog leaves initial focus selection to Base UI, excluding header Close
until focus enters. This preserves body-field or first-action focus; Base UI
retains ownership of touch behavior. Explicit `initialFocus` overrides remain
authoritative. Close then participates in the normal Tab cycle.

Preserve initial focus, return focus, Escape, outside-click, dirty-draft, and pending
behavior explicitly. An asynchronous operation must not gain a dismissal path that
loses work. Keep failure and recovery in the modal with entered values intact.
If a nested step consumes Escape, it must not also dismiss the parent.
For an imperatively mounted dialog, verify return focus after its nested picker
closes. If automatic restoration loses the trigger, pass the surviving trigger
through the shared `finalFocus` contract; preserve the shared guard against
stealing focus after the person moves elsewhere.

`AlertDialog` uses the compact geometry and the same header/body/action framing.
It retains alert-dialog semantics and pending dismissal protection. Pass
`initialFocus` when a confirmation has an established first-action focus target;
the header Close button must not silently replace that flow. Do not switch
confirmation semantics just to select a visual size.

### Menus, popovers, and pickers

Choose by interaction before choosing size. They share a material, not semantics:

| Need | Owner | Content structure |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Invoke an action or choose a lightweight mode | `Menu` / `ContextMenu` parts | Shared items, related groups, optional separators, and trailing selection marks |
| Edit a short value or show interactive supporting content | `Popover` parts | Named content, optional short description, fields/content, and local actions |
| Choose a form value | `Select` or `Combobox` | Labelled trigger/control and options; searchable values use Combobox |
| Brief help on a control | `Tooltip` | Short hint; the control still owns its accessible name |
| Rich preview of an object | `PreviewCard` | Supplemental content; no essential workflow available only on hover |
| Editor completion or embedded media picker | Existing feature adapter and shared popup recipe | Preserve editor focus, selection, and keyboard semantics |

Do not put a form in an action-menu item or simulate selectable values with a set
of unrelated buttons. Use `MenuNote` for non-action explanatory text and `tone="danger"`
for a destructive menu action; its icon inherits the danger color and highlighted/pressed
rows use the matching danger affordance. Select an existing compact/default/wide recipe for
the content; never make every popup compact just because the screen is narrow.
Shared owners handle collision, viewport bounds, layers, insets, corners, and motion.
Native top-layer message actions and hover previews yield to interactive menus,
pickers, and dialogs through the shared overlay-layer policy. An originating
toolbar keeps its anchor geometry but is hidden and cannot intercept popup clicks;
its target message remains highlighted while that toolbar's menu or picker is open.
Hover previews inside the active popup remain available. Do not add per-menu
suppression rules or a second overlay registry.
For choices that must stay within a modal, pass its element to
`Combobox.Popup collisionBoundary` when the picker opens. Base UI positions it
and the shared popup scrolls within the resulting available height; keep the portal.
Use their supported `padding`/alignment props; do not add another padded card inside
the popup or cancel its styles. Keep long lists scrollable and all actions reachable.

Opening a dialog from a menu needs a deliberate focus handoff: dismiss the menu
without stealing focus from the new dialog. On completion, return focus to the
appropriate surviving trigger unless the person has moved elsewhere. See
[`ChannelHeaderMenu`](../../bundled/channels/ChannelHeaderMenu.tsx) and the shared
[menus and choice-row rules](#menus-popovers-and-choice-rows).

### Hover timing

Hover content opens only once the pointer rests on its trigger, never while it
crosses on the way to something else; any movement restarts the wait. Keyboard
focus is deliberate, so it opens hints and previews at once, and anything that
opens on hover also opens with Enter; Escape dismisses them all. Every hover
surface belongs to exactly one bucket, and the timings live in
`ui/hoverIntent.ts`. The components accept a bucket, never a delay: to change a
timing, change the bucket for everyone. Submenus inside an open menu are the one
exception and open on hover at once, as menus conventionally do.

| Bucket | Use for | Timing | API |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Familiar hint | Naming an icon whose meaning is already obvious: back/forward, close, window controls, sidebar and pane toggles, new (+), more (…), send, attach, copy, download, refresh, delete, mute, reply, add reaction, bold/italic. An obvious icon stays familiar when its hint also shows a shortcut; a disabled one switches to helpful | Rests 1.5s | `Tooltip hint="familiar"`; `Button`/`IconButton` `title` with `hint="familiar"` |
| Helpful hint | Naming an icon people may not recognize, or adding information the control does not show: an unfamiliar control’s shortcut, why it is disabled, an error, a truncated value | Rests 0.5s | `Tooltip`, or `title` on `Button`/`IconButton` (the default) |
| Preview | Rich content about an object: a profile, link, channel, activity, typing participants, who reacted | Rests 0.6s | `PreviewCard`; `PopoverTrigger openOnHover="preview"` |
| Hover control | A control that expands in place under the pointer: video volume, playback speed | Rests 0.1s | `PopoverTrigger` or `MenuTrigger` with `openOnHover="control"` |
| No hover | A control whose visible text already says what it does | None | Omit `title` |

Hints share the app's `TooltipProvider`: once one is showing, its neighbors open
at once, so scanning a toolbar stays quick. Previews never open instantly from a
neighbor, so moving down a column of avatars opens nothing; the reaction row's
one preview may slide between its own pills once open (`PreviewCard warm`). The
accessible name is never the hint: an icon button keeps its `aria-label` in
every bucket.

### States, feedback, and motion

Design the states as part of the layout, not as unrelated replacement screens.
Keep useful existing content while refreshing. Show initial loading in the area
being loaded; put an error and retry beside the operation that failed. Distinguish
no results, nothing created yet, missing permission, unavailable host capability,
and failed loading. An empty result explains how to broaden the search; a setup
state offers a next step only if that action is available.
When discovery is partial, scope empty copy to the inspected collection. Missing
or failed reads do not prove absence. Keep a focused create or retry control
mounted when the body changes from loading to empty or populated.

### Loading without flicker

Delay progress feedback, not the work or its result. For initial reads and
non-blocking refreshes, keep loading text/spinners silent for the first second.
Use shared `LoadingRegion` for this timing and `aria-busy`; content appears as soon
as it is ready, with no minimum spinner duration. User-triggered writes such as
Save retain immediate pending feedback and repeat-action guards. Errors and
permission refusals appear immediately, never behind the loading delay. A routine
background check must not briefly repaint an otherwise usable control as disabled.
Keep draft-only actions available when safe, and merge asynchronous results into
the latest draft rather than a captured pre-refresh value. Use disabled treatment
only for genuine unavailability or a necessary blocking operation; do not add a
local color override to disguise a blocked action.

Keep the surface header, content frame, focus and scroll anchor mounted. Reserve
the content’s approximate final geometry on a first read rather than replacing a
form with a one-line loading message. LoadingRegion keeps a reserved status line;
its children own geometry. Unknown fields stay hidden/inert, not editable defaults
from another scope. Avoid decorative shimmer or a skeleton of every control.

Prefer already-verified content for the exact account/community/item while
refreshing, using its existing owner instead of a second cache or retaining whole
screens solely to avoid loading. Cached display is not fresh authorization. Gate
Save and other sensitive actions on the current read; preserve edits while applying
fresh values to untouched fields. A refresh failure keeps useful content and
edits with inline Retry, not a blank replacement page. Closing Settings still
discards unsaved drafts. Scope replacement retires stale reads and content.

Check fast, sustained, failed and retried reads, reopening and scope changes.
Tests control both operation completion and the feedback clock; DOM tests do not
prove layout stability. Inspect narrow/wide, both themes and enlarged text in the
actual host. Adopt this recipe surface by surface, not by delaying every spinner
or keeping permission-dependent UI alive across account changes.

Use `EmptyState` for a substantial settled empty/setup region. Use concise inline
status for a small subsection or loading state. A huge icon-only creation tile is
not a general empty-state recipe. Avoid stacking multiple borders, surfaces, or
success messages around a routine task. Keep important scope, privacy, destructive
consequences, and recovery copy; move it next to the relevant decision rather than
deleting it to make a layout quieter.

Use inline feedback for lasting problems and shared Toast for transient results.
Do not build another notification stack. Preserve labels, focus, and control size
while pending, and prevent repeated activation in behavior. Shared surfaces own
their motion: keyboard/high-frequency interactions stay immediate, exits do not
delay access to the underlying task, and reduced-motion behavior stays intact.
Do not add a page-wide entrance, result stagger, press scale, blur, or new timing
curve merely because a generic design recipe recommends one. Buzz's existing
[motion decisions](#motion) and named component exceptions take precedence.

Inspect the states that actually contain the affected controls. An unavailable
preview with no action cannot establish that the available action fits. Confirm
the control is present before checking bounds, and check changing labels such as
Sign in, Cancel, and Sign out at narrow widths with enlarged text.

### Plugin contribution boundaries

| Contribution | Host already owns | Contributor supplies |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Page | Shell navigation, outer workspace, activation/error boundary | Its interior composition, header where needed, padding/scrolling, data states, and local actions |
| `companion: true` page | Ready-to-render companion card | Placement in every state; reuse PanelFrame when suitable, without a second host dock |
| Panel mounted in PanelCard/PanelWorkspace | Outer surface, close behavior, and header or tabs | Object body and local interactions; inspect the actual host before adding chrome |
| Settings card/destination | Settings navigation, content column, contribution lifetime/error boundary | Content Header/grouping and controls; registration title is navigation metadata, not rendered content hierarchy |
| Channel launcher or menu contribution | Placement, surrounding header/menu, target selection | The supported launcher/item only; preserve host action sizing and lifecycle |
| Message/link/attachment renderer | Surrounding message and navigation contracts | Content inside that boundary; no duplicate author/actions or nested interactive target where the contract forbids it |

Source plugins can import the shared components directly. External plugins must
use the actual supported author contract and exposed CSS roles; source paths are
not a published component SDK. These are composition requirements for Buzz UI,
not a claim that arbitrary external code is automatically constrained. Do not
introduce a private reset, theme provider, palette, body-level stylesheet, global
control override, or parallel dialog/toast system to make one contribution fit.
Keep plugin styles scoped to owned layout/content. Renderer exceptions do not
exempt surrounding controls from shared appearance.

For a genuinely new surface, describe its task and the nearest recipe first.
State the missing capability and smallest extension in its existing owner. Keep
specialized behavior local until another real use justifies sharing it; do not
force every plugin into one universal page component. Read the
[plugin contracts](../../../docs/plugin-architecture.md) before changing host boundaries.

## Direction

Buzz adopts Block UI's visual language and semantic color grammar. Base UI
remains the behavior layer; Buzz owns styles, composition and product semantics.
Use Inter and JetBrains Mono, public dependencies and generic examples. Do not
copy private packages, proprietary fonts, internal product data or private source.

## Semantic colors

Use `color / purpose / emphasis / state`: surface, text, border and affordance.
An affordance is a control or action color. CSS spells these `--surface-panel`,
`--text-standard`, `--border-prominent` and `--affordance-subtle-hover`.
Tailwind utilities include `bg-surface-panel`, `text-standard`,
`border-prominent` and `bg-affordance-subtle-hover`. Text and border registrations
stay in separate namespaces so they cannot accidentally share a value.

Enabled sidebar section headings, disclosure chevrons and quiet section actions
use `text-subtle`, not `text-unavailable`. Disabled controls keep their shared
disabled state; a parent's inherited color must not override it.

Primary reading text and icons inheriting its color use `text-standard`: #0F0F0F
in light mode and #FFFFFF in dark mode. Secondary and disabled roles keep their
existing colors; prominent control fills and focus boundaries remain unchanged.

Components choose roles, not palette steps. The palette is an implementation
detail, even when a role uses the same step in both themes. Add a role only for
an actual use, document it in the registry and measure its intended pairings.
Legacy utilities and host aliases remain while their callers migrate. Do not
add new uses. Whole materials such as glass still travel as one shared recipe.

Solo, Multiplayer and Settings compose `SidebarNavigation` with the existing
NavigationItem and NavigationSection children. This component owns the appearance
already shipped in main: `text-navigation` read labels, body-sm Regular type,
28px rows at default scale, 2px block padding, 8px leading/6px trailing padding,
6px icon gap, shared selection, quiet hover and unavailable states. Static section
headings match the main sidebar's disclosure type/insets; rows sit 2px apart and
named groups 16px apart. Do not substitute generic row defaults or invent a
Settings-specific sidebar appearance.

SidebarNavigation has no landmark, surface, padding, layout box or scrollport:
its root uses `display: contents`, without a `data-buzz-ui` boundary that would
suppress native product-content defaults. Hosts keep their nav/aside semantics,
framing and scrolling. `wrapSections` lets Settings groups wrap in one shared
responsive layout when their host becomes narrow; do not reproduce that grid or
its margin reset in the modal or feature stylesheet. Shared selector rules live globally in the design system,
never nested inside feature CSS Modules via `@apply` (which renames their targets).
Features keep unread cues, branded headers, collapsible groups, drag targets and
composite row/scrollbar geometry; their existing layout rules remain in charge.
Top-bar pills and picker options are not sidebar rows and keep their own recipes.

Omit NavigationSection’s `label` for a headingless reference group: it keeps
ordinary section separation without an empty heading and spans the wrapped
navigation grid. Settings places its community URL copy action there above
“Community”; the action keeps its pointer Copy hint and never selects a destination.

Panel navigation uses `affordance-panel-hover` for its quiet hover and the shared
`affordance-selected` for persistent selection. In dark mode, the unfilled panel
row needs a quieter hover than a filled subtle control; these are distinct roles.

Anchored popup selection uses `affordance-popover-selected` (neutral 2 light /
neutral 6 dark). It stays visible on `surface-popover` independently of the quiet
neutral button and tab hover fill; mention and emoji suggestions use this
role for their active completion highlight.

## Foundations

The interface uses shared color, type, spacing and shape roles. Primary actions
are neutral. Text uses Inter for reading and labels, and JetBrains Mono for code
and identifiers. Regular (400) supports reading and form labels; Medium (500) marks actions and
structure. The Typography page documents each role’s complete setting.

Panel padding is 24px, control inset 16px, group gap 32px and page-section gap
64px at the default scale. Values are rem-based. A solid shell with a quiet,
hue-derived dot grid supports both color modes; content panels remain opaque.
Shell navigation uses flat fills, not glass. Dark text roles are selected for contrast on their intended surfaces.
Host compatibility names resolve to the shared tokens.

Features own layout, data and behavior. The foundation guard covers `src/`,
including the Emoji Mart adapter. Layout dimensions, emoji artwork geometry and
terminal ANSI/artwork remain renderer-owned; terminal controls use shared colors
and mono type.

This guide describes how to use the system: surface relationships, hierarchy,
identity, interaction and composition. The token registry documents the available
values and their purpose.

Run `pnpm design:dev` and open `/tests/fixtures/design-system.html` to see the system
rendered from the tokens themselves.

## Identity shapes

Human avatars are circular. Agent avatars are squircles. Use the shared
Avatar `shape="circle"` or `shape="squircle"`; the shape carries identity meaning,
not density or emphasis. The caller supplies identity type from domain data,
never a name or picture heuristic. `size="fill"` fills the owning layout’s
available space. Shape clips the artwork, never the interactive focus target.
Avatar-only controls use `IconButton variant="avatar"` so the surrounding backdrop
shows through their cutouts at rest, hover, press, and while a menu is open. The focus
target stays unmasked. Its keyboard-ring recipe follows the focus appearance
policy below.
Circular and squircle avatars can add `statusBadge="online" | "away" | "offline"`. The dot
uses a semantic green, yellow, or grey role with light and dark values. Its inset
cutout and dot scale with the existing avatar size; the dot is separate from the
clipped artwork, and avatars without a badge retain their full shape. The agent
cutout and badge follow the squircle contour; agent badges use live presence and leave
unknown status unbadged. All three statuses use solid fills: green for Online,
yellow for Away, and grey for Offline, with semantic light and dark values.
Online retains its step-10 center inside a 1px inset, same-hue step-11
outline, which supplies the 3:1 non-text boundary on supported opaque surfaces.
Away uses an unoutlined Amber 10 fill at the designer's explicit request.
**Known accessibility tradeoff:** the light Away badge falls below the WCAG
1.4.11 3:1 non-text contrast target on supported neutral surfaces. The contrast
guard reports exact accepted light-mode role/color/surface pairs; other pairs
remain enforced. This exception is not an accessibility pass. Dark Away meets
3:1 on these opaque surfaces. Offline stays unoutlined. Keep badge footprints, Bézier
artwork cutouts, presence behavior, and accessible names with the shared Avatar owner.

For a separate trailing action attached to a row, use `IconButton shape="row-end"`
in a stretched flex slot. It keeps the size-selected width, fills the row height,
and rounds only the right corners with `radius-row`. Decorative inverse corners
on the left extend the state fill around the preceding row's rounded edge without
expanding the hit target. They inherit the fill, including hover/pressed/menu-open
states, rather than painting over the adjacent surface. Hover uses the same
contextual row highlight as NavigationItem, not the brighter floating-button
step. Shared pressed and keyboard behavior remains unchanged.

## Public identity text

Public-key recognition labels use the shared pure formatter in
`src/shared/identity/public-key.ts`: `npub…` followed by the last three canonical
npub characters by default. This is text, not a component or a new identifier.
Use `formatPublicKey` for one label; use `publicKeyLabels` for an ambiguous group
so distinct keys receive a common suffix length that makes them distinguishable.
Inputs are public identity keys in hex, never credentials. Invalid inputs produce
no label; do not echo an invalid value as a fallback. Raw hex cannot establish
whether a caller supplied a secret: callers must use public-identity fields only.

Keep the full key for routing, persistence, identity comparisons, and explicit key
copy actions. Short labels are recognition aids, not proof of identity. Full-key
inspection/export surfaces remain explicit exceptions. Reuse this formatter for new
abbreviated public-key displays; migrate existing surfaces deliberately.

Identity display names use the active naming policy, not a separate composer rule.
The default policy compares trimmed resolved names case-sensitively (`Honey` and
`honey` are different). It ranks the viewer human, other humans, viewer-owned agents,
then other agents. Unique names stay plain; ties do not choose an arbitrary winner.
Readable owner/agent labels come before last-four npub endings, extended only when
needed. These policy qualifiers are distinct from standalone abbreviated-key labels.

Views supply the comparison set: channel members for reading (plus the referenced
historical identity), DM participants for DM labels, and complete eligible choices
before search filtering for pickers and composer chips (plus existing recipients).
Removing a selected chip does not remove an otherwise eligible namesake from that
set. Repeating one identity is not ambiguous. Live profile and membership changes
update display labels, never authored message source, recipient spans, copyable
text, or notification targets. Accessible names spell out a public-key ending
when the policy uses one. With no active policy, use profile/caller fallbacks.

When an existing composer chip gains a qualifier, reveal only the qualifier with
shared settle motion; newly inserted chips appear at rest. Ordinary typing must
not replay the reveal. The suffix stays visible while a long name ellipsizes.
Removal is immediate and reduced motion disables the reveal animation.

## Posture

Buzz is a place for people and their agents to build together. Keep everyday
surfaces quiet and functional so the conversation stays central. Use character
in identity, guidance, transitions, and ceremony. Use color to convey meaning.

## Surface and depth

Use the surface that matches the content and its position in the interface.

- **Panels:** the shell uses an independent `Panel` for sidebar navigation and one `Panel joined` around the main content workspace, separated by `space-panel-gap` (8px at default scale). The sidebar resize grip stays centered in that gutter. Both retain opaque surfaces when navigation overlays at narrow widths. Nested Panels keep their opaque fill and clipping but lose independent borders, corners, and shadows. The layout owner separates adjacent regions with `border-standard` hairlines. Standalone Panels use `radius-container` (24px) corners and `shadow-panel` for a translucent contour and subtle lift, rather than an opaque depth border.
- **Recessed regions:** use `bg-inset` for a region pushed into its surrounding surface. Use quiet fills where they communicate separation; reserve outlines for boundaries that need to be identified.
- **Shell:** `bg-app` is a solid color, neutral-quiet-hover in light mode and neutral 2 in dark. The shell owns one continuous `texture-dots` grid beneath its header, rail and panes. Dots derive from this background: darker in light mode, lighter in dark mode, never an unrelated gray. The app root owns the background and its texture together. Do not override a descendant background and expect inherited texture colors to recompute. The pattern is decorative; do not increase its contrast to communicate state.
- **Reading surfaces:** documentation and dense prose sit on opaque `bg-panel`. Keep the dot grid outside reading panes. Do not add gradient backgrounds to the app shell.
- **Borders:** use `border-standard` for quiet separators, `border-prominent` for controls, and `border-focus` for keyboard-focus recipes. Errors and warnings have their own boundary roles. Measure the actual pairing in both themes.
- **Shadows:** use the shared elevation roles and keep them subtle. Light mode relies on shadow; dark mode also raises the fill’s lightness. Do not strengthen a shadow to separate a dark floating surface.

### Floating surfaces

Menus, Select, Popover, and PreviewCard share `floating-surface`: a 90% opaque
mode-aware fill, 8px backdrop blur, 24px `radius-container` corners,
and shared lift. The elevation recipe supplies a crisp contour, contact shadow,
and ambient shadow in light mode, and a quiet white contour in dark mode. A
transparent 1px border preserves inset geometry without doubling the contour. `popover-surface` composes this same recipe for feature-owned
anchored content. Reduced transparency, forced colors, and browsers without blur
support use the opaque fill.

Default menus, selects, and list popovers share a 4px list inset. Content popovers
use 12px padding. Menu items and select options share 8px vertical / 12px
horizontal padding and corners derived from the outer radius and inset. Their hover treatment also comes from the same rule. Use Menu for
actions and nested submenus, Select for a value, and Popover for interactive
content; Base UI retains each control's keyboard and focus semantics.

Short action menus and compact account popovers retain 16px `radius-row`
corners, a 2px list inset, and concentric inner rows. Choose compact for the content,
never automatically because the viewport is narrow. Dialogs and alert dialogs
use opaque `surface-popover` so inset fields stay distinct above the dimmed
page, retaining their 28px `radius-panel` corners and modal backdrop. Stepped
dialogs apply the fill to each step; their shared wrapper stays transparent.

### Corner scale and nesting

Standalone containers use the 12 / 16 / 20 / 24 / 28px scale: `radius-chip` for
tight details, `radius-row` for independent rows, `radius-control` for fields,
`radius-container` for medium containers and standard floating surfaces, and
`radius-panel` for large surfaces. These are rem-based values at the default
scale. Circles, capsules and pills are separate shape roles; full-window sheets
can be square.

When a nested fill or container follows its parent's contour, use
`max(0px, outer radius - inset)`, measured between the painted edges. Include
padding and the parent's border in that inset. Do not round a derived radius
back to a scale step: a 24px menu with 4px padding and a 1px border has 19px
row corners; a 16px compact menu with the same inset has 11px row corners.

`floating-surface` owns `--floating-radius`, `--floating-inset` (the padding),
and `--floating-inner-radius` (subtracting its 1px border). Menu, Select,
list-popover and completion fills consume that derived radius. A feature that
changes the surface padding must update `--floating-inset` on the same owner.
An additional nested container measures from its immediate painted parent.
Hover, selected, pressed and focus fills retain the same geometry. Edge-to-edge
fills inherit the container radius and clip at its boundary. Independent controls
and identity artwork retain their own shapes rather than becoming concentric
with an unrelated container.

Floating rows use `affordance-floating-hover` (neutral 2 light / neutral 5 dark).
Supporting text becomes standard text on highlight. Keep persistent selection
independent of hover. Compact menus use `affordance-subtle-hover` with immediate
feedback and retain their separate selected fill.

### Glass

Use glass where a gradient, image, or content is visible behind it. Apply the
complete material so fill, blur, rim, and optional shadow stay together.

- More opaque glass reads as a higher layer. A brighter fill alone does not communicate the same depth.
- Keep the rim’s light direction consistent across surfaces. Use a border role when you need a visible boundary rather than a material edge.
- Avoid adding a glass fill when the region already covers an identical glass parent. Two `glass-2` layers composite to 0.77 alpha and become more opaque than either intended layer.
- Shell panes and navigation do not use glass. Floating popovers and media controls retain their existing material recipes.

Opaque contrast checks do not validate translucent materials over arbitrary
content. Inspect the actual background, text and interaction states wherever
glass remains; the flat shell does not establish a general glass contrast guarantee.

Proposed: `Button` / `IconButton variant="glass-ghost"` is quiet at rest over
artwork and reveals the complete primary glass material on pointer hover or
while pressed/expanded. Compact Select forwards `appearance="glass-ghost"`.
Agent-card menus and model choices use it. Blur stays fixed; artwork and control
geometry do not animate. Reduced transparency, forced colors, and unsupported
backdrop filtering use an opaque panel fill with a boundary. Keep the ordinary
shared keyboard focus ring and disabled behavior.

Proposed for profile artwork: `Button variant="glass"` uses the complete
`glass-secondary` material, with a stronger fill on hover and an opaque pressed
state. It retains shared focus, loading, and disabled behavior. Reduced
transparency, forced colors, and missing backdrop-filter support use an opaque
panel fill. Use it over artwork, not on ordinary neutral profile headers.

### Match controls to their surface

The shell groups creation, page tabs, and search in one `chrome-navigation`
track. Nested chrome tabs retain their selected fill without a second track.
Layout and overflow remain shell-owned.

Use `Tabs variant="segmented"` for grouped filters on an opaque surface, with
a capsule track and raised capsule selection (for example, sidebar scope).
Proposed: `Tabs variant="segmented-icons"` uses the same track for icon-only
avatar choices, retaining accessible labels and titles. Each item supplies an icon.
Use `Tabs variant="chrome"` for a flat pill selection on the shell and `variant="panel"`
for an underline on a plain surface. IconButton also provides a `chrome` variant.
Chrome tab and route-navigation groups use the shell's `affordance-chrome` capsule
(neutral 3 in light mode, distinct from the app background),
with `affordance-chrome-hover` for an inactive item and `text-chrome-subtle` labels. Selection uses the pane color
in light mode and neutral 5 in dark mode, where it stays stronger than hover.
Chrome icon controls inside the shared track use the same hover fill as its tabs.
Standalone chrome icon controls remain unfilled and use backdrop hover/pressed
fills. No blur or glass rim is added.
A chrome selection can blend into a white panel; choose the appropriate variant
instead of retinting `--bg-chrome-selected` for one caller. Keep shared behavior
in one component and show both surface variants in its examples.

A selection and a hover describe the same object, so they occupy the same box.
The chrome pill fills its tab rather than sitting inset within it; insetting the
selection alone draws it shorter than the hover beside it, and the two states
stop agreeing on where a tab is. The container's own padding is the frame.

Panel tabs keep labels at intrinsic width and scroll within the Base UI tablist
when space is limited. Keyboard navigation reveals the focused tab. The surrounding
panel grid must have a shrinkable column so tabs do not widen other content.

## Focus appearance

Keyboard focus is visible, and the component recipes in this guide own the ring.
Every recipe is gated on the app-root modality fact `html[data-keyboard-navigation]`,
so a pointer press leaves nothing behind. Keep focusability, Tab order, input
modality, selection, and focus restoration intact, and do not add a local
replacement ring where a component recipe already exists.

Shared text fields are the one deliberate exception, and they replace the ring
rather than removing it. `styles/forms.css` drops the outline for editable
`.buzz-input`, `.buzz-textarea` and rich textboxes; read-only controls keep their
keyboard rings. Those fields use
a border flush with the field perimeter: surface-inset fill and a 1px
border-prominent stroke fading over 150ms ease for pointer interaction. The
field-scoped --border variable selects transparent, active, or error color for
the reserved 1px border, so state changes do not shift the layout. Keyboard
focus and reduced motion change immediately. Composite fields own one stroke
around the input and actions; error strokes retain priority. Borderless title and
heading inputs keep their perimeter transparent on pointer/autofocus entry and
when invalid, where the connected error carries validation, and show the focus
border during keyboard navigation. Placeholders use
text-metadata, one step quieter than supporting text, in both themes. This supersedes
the older keyboard-only
and no-container-ring recipes for these fields.

The composer is the second deliberate exception, and it is a container treatment
rather than a control ring. `styles/composer.css` clears the textarea's own
outline and lets `.buzz-composer:focus-within` carry focus on the shell: the 1px
perimeter border switches to `--border-focus` and a matching 1px ring doubles
it, so the composite reads as one focused surface instead of a ring around the
text area inside a bordered box. The resting shell uses `surface-composer`:
panel fill in light mode and neutral-4 in dark mode, preserving the former
dark stroke color as its fill. Both composer hosts use `data-composer-surface`
to opt into the shared surface context: in dark mode, `affordance-subtle`, its
hover and pressed roles use neutral-5, neutral-6 and neutral-7. Inline code,
reference chips and recipient pills retain distinct nested fills without local
control overrides. Light mode and controls outside the composer are unchanged.
The context reapplies `interaction-panel` on the composer so shared controls
resolve their fill, hover and pressed aliases against these local roles.
Dark standard borders use neutral-5 so separators remain distinct from panels.
Focus retains the existing `border-focus` stroke and ring.
Unlike the text-field exception this is not modality-gated, because the shell
also marks where typing will land. Do not copy the container pattern to a
control that has a component ring recipe.

`SearchField` is an unresolved gap, not a policy: `styles/search-field.css`
cancels the ring on both the field and its clear button to match a global
override that no longer exists, and its 1px perimeter border does not react to
focus, so the control has no visible focus state. Do not copy it.

## Surface-aware interactions (proposed)

Opaque surface owners provide a CSS interaction recipe: `interaction-panel`
(default and Panel) or `interaction-floating` (Dialog, floating-surface and
popover-surface). The recipe follows the painted DOM root, including portals;
there is no React provider or runtime color detection. Native modal adapters
using the floating fill opt into the same utility. Transparent groups inherit;
a nested opaque Panel resets. Feature-only surfaces must opt into the recipe
matching their paint; an arbitrary background utility alone is not a context.

Inherited custom-property aliases resolve on the owner, not again on each child.
The ordinary recipe binds at every theme owner (`:root` and scoped `.dark`),
including always-dark media inside a light app. This default belongs in the base
layer: explicit floating, nested Panel and semantic recipes must win on the same
node. Adding a scoped theme requires rebinding its dependent aliases too.
Do not override upstream `--affordance-*` values on a wrapper to retint controls.
The existing semantic exceptions have named shared recipes: `interaction-availability`
on the status owner uses `data-status="online" | "away" | "offline"` (unknown stays
neutral) for the documented status capsule fills, while SidebarNavigation
on the sidebar keeps channel rows and session selection equally quiet. Apply these
only to their semantic owners, not as general styling escape hatches. Button and
NavigationItem still do not accept caller-supplied `className`; popup portals keep
their own floating recipe. Availability's existing contrast exceptions remain
recorded in `docs/presence.md`.

Top-bar ghost icon actions remain unfilled at rest. Their backdrop hover and
pressed roles use translucent fills (black 6% / 10% in light mode, white 10% / 16%
in dark mode), so the shell and its dot texture remain visible. The shell owns this context;
content-panel actions retain their opaque surface recipes. Only the fill is
translucent: icons stay at full opacity, without adding blur or a rim.

Actions consume contextual fill/hover/pressed/selected/boundary roles rather than
redefining global semantic tokens that also color avatars or chips. Floating
rows remain transparent at rest, then use the existing floating highlight with
standard supporting text. Persistent selection is separate from hover. Compact
menus retain their quieter highlight and use a distinct selected fill.

Fields retain surface-inset and their existing invalid/disabled/focus behavior;
only active boundaries adapt to the surrounding surface. Actions inside an
InputGroup reset to the ordinary recipe because their backdrop is the inset
field. Unchecked checkbox/radio and outline boundaries use the contextual
boundary too. Prominent/destructive actions and switch geometry/state colors
are unchanged. No extra hover affordance is added to static content.

The floating control mappings are proposed, not an accessibility certification.
Dark floating action fills are neutral-6/7/8 at rest/hover/press, on the
neutral-raised (#282828) floating surface; those fill edges are below 3:1. The contextual control
stroke uses neutral-9 and clears 3:1 against that outer surface. This proof does
not change the shared [focus appearance policy](#focus-appearance), which applies
in both the app and viewer. Glass/inverse/media surfaces retain their existing
explicit treatments, outside this opaque-surface proof.

The Floating surfaces viewer shows actions, rows, fields and choices in actual
shared Panel/Dialog/Popover components, including a nested Panel reset. Verify
both themes, portals, supported states and actual product flows before adoption
is called complete; token math alone cannot validate the CSS cascade.

## Controls

An Input that must retain focus during asynchronous work can pair `readOnly` with
`aria-disabled="true"` to use the shared disabled appearance without removing
keyboard focus. Its feature owner must prevent edits and keep `aria-busy` on the
working region; `aria-disabled` alone does not prevent native input.

Navigation labels are controls, not selectable document text. `NavigationItem`,
tabs, and sidebar section/project disclosure headings prevent text selection,
including when opening a context menu. Keep this behavior on the navigation
control, not the shared context-menu trigger: messages, inline message links,
and readable content remain selectable. Editable fields retain normal selection.
Channel and chat sidebar rows whose context menu is visible keep their hover
treatment through dismissal, without changing the selected destination. Selected
rows retain their selected treatment. `ContextMenuTrigger` exposes
`data-context-menu-present` for this visible lifetime, including the exit fade;
features keep the row's treatment with its existing surface owner.

Button and IconButton share prominent, subtle, ghost, inverted, destructive,
outline and link emphasis. Inverted is for an inverse surface; link keeps its
background clear and underlines on interaction. Button’s plain variant keeps the background clear
without underlining, for text disclosures whose label and chevron communicate
expansion. It retains shared disabled, loading, and keyboard-focus behavior;
pair it with `size="inline"` for quiet history labels. Their 32 / 40 / 52px sizes are sm / md /
lg at the default scale, with minimum
heights that accommodate larger text. Text buttons use `--radius-capsule`
(2.125rem / 34px): capsule-shaped through the default 52px large size,
clamped naturally on shorter controls, and bounded on taller ones. Reuse this
role for similarly sized actions; `--radius-pill` remains the fully round role
for circles and pills of any height. Fields retain `--radius-control`.

Settings scopes the text-button radius to 20px `--radius-control` so actions
use rounded rectangles. Icon actions retain their independent 18px radius.

Floating unread cues and Jump to latest use Button's `shape="control"` with
20px `--radius-control` corners in every state. Any backing surface uses the
same radius so its painted edges align with the button.
A sidebar unread cue is strong (`prominent`) only when a DM, a mention of you or
a thread reply waits past its edge; ordinary unread uses the `subtle` Button,
whose light gray fill holds up over the list where glass would disappear.

The message hover toolbar uses the 12px rounded-container radius
with a 2px inset. Its independent icon actions retain their shared 10px corners.

Secondary actions on rows inside a compact inset container, currently queued
follow-ups, use Button `subtle-muted` with `size="caption"`: a 32px control
with caption text in `--text-subtle` that strengthens on hover, press and
focus. Their removal glyph uses IconButton `destructive-quiet`, resting in
`--text-quiet-control` (non-text contrast) and turning danger on hover and
press. `shape="inset"` takes the container's `--control-inset-radius`
(container radius minus inset) so nested corners stay concentric. Reuse these
only for the same row-action role.

Button labels stay on one line and do not shrink in flex layouts (`whitespace-nowrap
shrink-0`). Parents must reflow whole controls or provide
scrolling when space is limited. Composite reply summaries may reflow whole
avatar/count groups without wrapping individual labels. Thread reply summaries
use the same 10px corners as icon actions, including hover and pressed fills.
Small buttons use 16px
side padding and 16px icons; medium and large use 24px side padding and 24px icons.
Proposed: medium labelled buttons with a leading icon use 12px leading and 16px
trailing padding for optical balance. Text-only and icon-only buttons retain their
existing insets.
Standard Button labels use the complete `text-label-sm` role with an 8px icon gap; the
extra-small capsule uses `text-caption`. For a caption-sized inline choice such as
the composer's model name, `size="inline"` keeps a 24px minimum target with 4px
horizontal padding and icon gap, and 12px icons. Pair it with `variant="ghost"`
for an unframed label; shared hover, disabled, and keyboard focus still apply.

Button defaults to `md` (40px minimum height); IconButton defaults to `sm`
(32px square with 16px artwork) and a 10px rounded rectangle
(`--radius-icon-button`). Choose `md` or `lg` explicitly when an icon action needs
a larger control; community rail identities and the avatar edit badge retain their
existing larger treatment. These defaults do not depend on pointer type or viewport
width. Both controls use the same sm/md/lg scale. Existing names
remain compatibility aliases: primary/solid → prominent, quiet → subtle,
compact/toolbar → sm, default → md, large → lg. Do not add new alias call sites.
Buzz's tint and chrome icon variants remain for composer and backdrop actions.

Proposed: when a trigger changes between icon-only and labelled content, keep one
`Button` mounted and switch `shape="icon"` / `shape="capsule"`. The icon shape
reuses IconButton's square geometry and rounded corners; provide an accessible
name. The workspace picker uses this to preserve menu focus restoration across
selection changes. Standalone icon actions continue to use `IconButton`.

Disabled controls retain their filled, outline, or unfilled treatment and cannot
activate. Loading retains the label's geometry, accessible name, focus and variant
colors while blocking activation; never swap in a differently sized loading label.
Pointer hover uses shared state timing; expanded triggers retain pressed emphasis.
Keep keyboard-only focus and reduced-motion behavior owned by the system.

The proposed `attention` variant is used by overdue reminder snooze actions.
It reuses the outline button's 1px inset stroke and capsule geometry, tinting
the stroke with `border-danger` at 45% opacity. Dashes travel slowly around the
perimeter, advancing one 8px dash-and-gap cycle every 3s with linear timing.
The capsule and label stay still. Reduced motion and disabled/loading states
keep the dashed border static. This is a status cue, so retain an
explicit status label or group heading and the scheduled time. Danger hover
and pressed fills, disabled boundaries, and keyboard focus remain shared.

IconButton's `bare` variant has no resting, hover, pressed or selected
background. Use it where something else already supplies the state:

- Toggles whose glyph shows the state. Small toggles use 20px artwork inside
  the same 32px hit area, so the glyph's state is easy to distinguish. The caller
  supplies outline/filled artwork, aria-pressed and the accessible name.
- Actions revealed by a row, such as a sidebar row's overflow menu. Row hover
  reveals the action and the row's own hover or selected fill is its state, so a
  second fill inside the row would compete with it (and, on a brand-filled
  selection, lose its paired ink).

Bare keeps the standard control size and focus behavior. Only glyph-state
toggles enlarge the artwork; ordinary actions use the same artwork sizing as
other IconButtons.

IconButton also offers `xs` (20px with 12px icons) for dense formatting actions. Mode
toggles remain `sm`.

An `xs` Button whose label starts with an icon reduces its leading padding to its
4px vertical padding, so the icon sits evenly in the capsule's leading corner.

Utility icon actions share the rounded rectangle in resting, hover, pressed, and
selected states. Avatar controls default to round; use `shape="round"` for deliberate
circular controls such as media playback, the avatar edit badge, and Add reaction.
Top-bar, sidenav and content-toolbar icon actions share square 32px containers, 16px artwork,
and the same 10px radius on all four corners, including actions beside the outer
panel edge. The top bar retains its translucent backdrop interaction fills.
These independent control shapes stay separate from the container scale and
derived nested-fill corners.
Disabled ghost icons remain unfilled; their muted foreground communicates unavailability without
adding a container to an otherwise empty toolbar.

Composer picker surfaces use the 16px `--radius-container` role and the shared
popup motion below. Filtering does not stagger results. Search fields follow
the shared form treatment below.

Field groups label, input, help and error using Base UI. Input and Textarea
carry the shared field appearance. RadioGroup is for one choice, Checkbox for an
independent choice and Switch for an immediate on/off setting. Use the native
form semantics exposed by those Base UI primitives rather than duplicating them.

`Checkbox` and `Radio` default to 40px rows with 20px controls. For compact
inline choices, use `size="sm"`: 32px rows, 16px controls, and an 8px label gap.
Pair small radios with `RadioGroup size="sm"` to remove the extra group gap.
Compact filter popovers use `padding="list"`; keep room around a scrolling
choice list for the shared keyboard focus ring.

For finite choices, use Select: its inline layout fits compact toolbars and
`variant="field"` fits labelled forms. The proposed `variant="compact"` fits
trailing row choices: a small outlined trigger with a quiet `border-standard`
boundary and a visually hidden accessible
label, bounded single-line value, and full choice text in the popup and value hint.
Its popup has an 11.25rem minimum (bounded by the viewport) and reserves the
selection-mark slot in every option so selecting the widest label cannot resize it.
Compact choices can pass `valueSuffix` for short metadata that must stay visible,
such as an agent card's Default source. It sits directly after the value on the
same line; only the value truncates. Keep the full choice in the popup and value
hint. The caller owns its column width; in PreferenceRow a compact choice takes at
most 60% of the row, beyond its min-content width, so a long value ellipsizes
before the row title loses its words. Other trailing controls keep their width.
`align="end"` anchors a trailing choice popup to the trigger’s right edge; the
default remains `start`. Pass `disabled` explicitly when the choice is unavailable. An option may include one concise supporting
description; Select shows it as a byline in the popup while the closed trigger
retains only the option label. For searchable choices, use the shared Combobox parts; keep
filtering, custom-value commits, and async requests with the feature. Its Control
owns the label, input and integrated browse caret; Popup and Item own the shared
menu presentation. For a closed dropdown with search inside, use Combobox.Trigger
and Combobox.Popup with search; opening focuses the popup search input.
Use its loading state while discovering options, and keep
retry/cancel actions with the feature. Do not style a native select as an Input
or attach a separate round button to mimic a combobox.

### Form composition

Select and Combobox chevrons rotate 180 degrees to reflect the trigger's
aria-expanded state. Use duration-state (150ms) with easing-settle for a
reversible transform transition. Keyboard navigation and reduced motion switch
the orientation immediately. Loading indicators keep their separate behavior.

Fields share a 40px minimum size at the default scale, the control radius,
text-body (14px / 20px), and the 16px control inset. Derive vertical padding from the control
size, text line height, and boundary; do not force a fixed height that clips
larger text or wrapped Select values. Textarea uses the control inset on all four
sides (16px at the default scale), with manual vertical resizing and a code variant.
Agent instructions intentionally use `appearance="outlined"`: one container-radius
border over a transparent background, with no inset fill or nested SettingsGroup.
Focus strengthens that same border. Preserve this choice in creation and profiles.
Use `surface="panel"` when a standalone textarea needs an opaque surface over a
floating dialog; the default inset surface remains for fields on panels.
In Chromium and WebKit, the native resize grip uses text-metadata and sits 4px
(space-1) inside the corner. Keep it visible at rest. Preserve the native resize hit target and
leave the browser grip unchanged where custom resizer styling is unsupported.

Use Field once per input/textarea, with an 8px internal gap. Select's field
variant, SearchField, and Combobox.Control already own their label and supporting
text; do not add a second Field around them. Use description/error for connected
help and validation. An error replaces the secondary description until it clears;
keep the accessible description synchronized with the visible message. Field's
error opens its space in place of the field gap while fading in, with
`--duration-settle` and `--easing-settle`, so content below moves instead of
jumping; reduced motion shows it immediately. Errors outside Field stay static. Validation
strokes belong to the outer field, never its auxiliary buttons. Keep feature-owned
asynchronous status connected through
aria-describedby. Forms own 16px between adjacent fields and the 32px section
gap between named groups.

InputGroup shares the inline frame for SearchField and Combobox. Icons use an
8px gap, and trailing actions retain a stable slot. SearchField uses the same
20px control radius as other fields, with no separate navigator shape. Focus belongs to
the input or action,
while the frame owns the active perimeter stroke. Read-only values can be
read and copied; disabled actions cannot change a value. Search clear restores
input focus. Features still own filtering, custom values, and async recovery.

SearchField, Combobox.Control, and code Textarea default to no autocorrection,
capitalization, or spellcheck. Callers can override these defaults explicitly.
Ordinary Input and prose Textarea retain platform defaults. Check the defaults in
`ui/SearchField.tsx`, `ui/Combobox.tsx`, and `ui/Textarea.tsx` when adding an exact-text
field.

The Forms page in Just Design documents states, usage, and a form-in-dialog
example. Review it with both themes, narrow widths, and enlarged text before
introducing another form treatment.

Select and Combobox popups use a 150ms entrance and 120ms exit from the shared
state/fast duration tokens. Fade opacity with easing-state and move 4px from the
trigger with easing-settle, reversing the direction above the trigger. The
designer-requested blur from 4px to zero is a narrow exception to the general
no-blur-animation rule. Base UI owns transition presence and dismissal; keyboard
navigation and reduced motion remove the transition, movement, and blur.

### Menus, popovers, and choice rows

Use Menu for actions and lightweight choices, Popover for supporting content or
short forms, and Select/Combobox for form values. Both anchored surfaces reuse
`floating-surface`, viewport collision handling, and the shared popover layer.
Features own their data, callbacks and save/cancel behavior; Base UI owns focus,
keyboard navigation, positioning and dismissal.

Menu group labels belong inside MenuGroup. `emphasis="quiet"` uses metadata
color for lower-emphasis group labels. Radio items may use `selection="highlight"`
for a single-choice view: the checked item has a persistent selection fill and no
check icon. Default radio and checkbox items retain their trailing checks.
Trailing selection checks and persistent selection fills remain independent
of the pointer/keyboard highlight.
Keep the parent row highlighted while its submenu is open. Use `tone="danger"`
for destructive actions and MenuNote for explanatory or status copy outside the
keyboard item list. Long lists scroll inside the popup.

ChoiceRow arranges a label, wrapping description, optional artwork and trailing
metadata. It adds no second click target or tab stop. Keep its slots non-interactive
and let the containing item own state and padding. Use the small shared avatar
for identity choices, retaining human/agent shapes.

PopoverPopup uses 16px content padding, or `padding="list"` when its rows own their
spacing. Use `size="compact"` with list padding for short account/action surfaces: 14rem
width and 16px corners. `MenuPopup size="compact"` uses the same corner, inset, row and
hover treatment for short action lists. Content and wide popovers retain 24px corners.
Name it with PopoverTitle or aria-label; PopoverDescription connects
supporting copy. Hover opening is optional and remains configured by its feature.
Use `padding="none"` for an embedded picker that owns its internal spacing, such as
emoji/GIF content.
Dropdown menus, submenus, and popovers use a quicker version of the form dropdown
motion: 75ms entry and 60ms exit (half the state/fast duration tokens), a 2px offset
and blur-to-sharp opacity fade. Movement uses easing-settle; opacity and filter use
easing-state. The offset follows the actual placement side toward the trigger,
including collision flips and nested menus. This extends the designer-requested
blur exception to these anchored surfaces. Context menus appear immediately,
without an entrance fade, movement, or blur; dismissal retains only the 60ms
opacity fade. The shared menu root owns this distinction, so dropdowns opened
inside a context-menu target and nested submenus keep their ordinary motion.
Keyboard navigation and reduced motion remove transitions, movement, and blur. The Just
Design Menu, Popover and ChoiceRow pages
show these contracts and their compositions.

## Compositions

### Panel headers

Composer model cards explicitly use `PanelHeader variant="card"`: one line with
a truncating agent name and fixed trailing icon actions, without a divider.
This does not change workspace headers or authorize adding chrome to other content cards.

Every workspace pane and full-page destination has one shared `PanelHeader` at
its top, outside the scrolling body. If the containing workspace already supplies
that header, reuse it rather than adding a second one. Keep the frame present
during loading, empty, error, and populated states. Content cards and Settings
groups are not workspace panes and do not each need chrome.

The approved visual reference is the main channel header in
[`ChannelsPage.tsx`](../../bundled/channels/ChannelsPage.tsx): compact identity at
the leading edge and **icon-only actions at the trailing edge**. Reuse the shared
components, not a screenshot's measured offsets.

- **Leading identity:** static destinations use `PanelHeaderLabel`, including its
  icon slot and title typography. Omit the icon when there is no meaningful one.
  Existing channel/workspace tabs retain `Tabs variant="navigation"`; the channel's
  single non-closable tab uses `showSelection={false}`. Do not invent tab semantics
  for a static page just to reproduce its appearance.
- **Trailing actions:** use `IconButton size="sm" variant="ghost"` with 1rem
  artwork, an action-specific `aria-label`, and a matching `title` hint. Use the
  shared Menu with an icon-only trigger for overflow. Keep permission, pending,
  disabled, expanded, and focus behavior with the action's current owner.
- **Text actions:** a labelled action such as “Add agent” belongs in the content
  or empty state. If it is available in panel chrome, render it as an icon action
  with that accessible name. Never shrink, clip, or locally restyle a text button
  to make it fit the header. Destructive confirmations retain explicit text actions.
- **Navigation:** use the `navigation` slot for local back/close controls. Keep
  title, navigation, and actions in their designated slots; do not build a parallel
  header layout inside the body or add wrapper gaps around actions.
- **Limited space:** preserve control hit areas and the shared title truncation.
  Group secondary actions in the existing overflow menu when needed. Shared
  wrapping is a fallback, not a reason to add oversized controls. Verify long
  titles and enlarged text; no action may become unreachable.

Static-pane composition (imports come from the shared UI and icon gateways;
`openAddAgent`, `canAddAgent`, and pending state remain feature-owned):

```tsx
<PanelHeader
  title={<PanelHeaderLabel title="Agents" />}
  actions={
    <IconButton
      size="sm"
      variant="ghost"
      icon={<PlusIcon size="1rem" aria-hidden="true" />}
      aria-label="Add agent"
      title="Add agent"
      aria-haspopup="dialog"
      disabled={!canAddAgent || pending}
      onClick={openAddAgent}
    />
  }
/>
```

`PanelHeader` currently accepts arbitrary React nodes and bare strings. That API
flexibility does not enforce this composition. In particular, the existing Agents
text action and Projects' standalone large title are adoption gaps, not templates
for new screens. Review action producers too, including actions portalled into a
header from another component.

### Header geometry

PanelHeader owns one consistent header frame: leading `navigation`, title/icon,
and trailing `actions`. `PanelHeaderLabel` supplies the smaller tab-aligned
label role; omit its optional icon for image and video detail titles. Use a small IconButton with ArrowLeft for a local back
action and X for closing the panel. The default 2.5rem (40px at the default root size) minimum height aligns conversation,
thread, profile, tabbed workspace, and Todos headers. The compact variant shares
this height. Headers use 0.25rem inline padding (matching the centered 2rem controls’
block inset), 1rem identity icons, and
0.25rem gaps between action buttons without reducing their hit areas. Navigation
tabs use 1rem icons or fill avatars and 0.5rem leading padding.
Header spacing, icons, and controls scale with rem; separators remain
1px hairlines. Titles and actions may wrap when their content needs more room.
Static identities use PanelHeaderLabel to share navigation tabs’ icon slot,
regular title weight, and leading inset without adding a tab stop. Terminal context
can follow the label; Inbox and Bestie use the same composition.
Navigation state, focus restoration, and content transitions belong to the host.

### Content hierarchy and layout

Pane chrome identifies where you are. The body holds the work: descriptions,
filters, lists, forms, and their labelled actions. Use `Header` only when the body
needs its own introduction, and `InlineHeader` for named sections. Do not repeat
“Projects” as a large body heading immediately below a Projects pane header.
Preserve Settings' documented content headings inside its shared workspace.

Use the owning layout's shared panel inset and spacing tokens. Align headings,
list content, and form labels to consistent leading edges. Keep related controls
closer than separate groups; use the existing field and section gaps rather than
adding separators between every group. Keep section actions with that section,
not in unrelated pane chrome. Apply the [row alignment rule](#align-row-content-not-state-backgrounds)
when state backgrounds extend beyond the content edge.

Let the body shrink and scroll within its pane (`min-height: 0` / `min-width: 0`
where the layout requires them); do not make the whole workspace scroll to reach
local content. Keep controls reachable at narrow widths and enlarged text, and
use logical inline/block properties for content alignment. Preserve the existing
host's scrolling and focus ownership rather than adding another scroll container.

### Dialogs and supporting compositions

Composer pickers reuse PopoverPopup and anchor above the whole composer with a
4px gap, preserving the shared popup behavior and material.

Dialog composes a Base UI modal with a shared title, optional description, body,
close button and actions. Pending operations set preventClose so Escape and the
close button agree. Ordinary dialogs dismiss on outside click through their
Cancel/Close path, including nested confirmations that dismiss only their own
layer; protected forms and one-time content set `dismissOnOutsideClick={false}`. `preventClose` blocks
pointer dismissal as well as Escape and Close. Provide initialFocus for search dialogs and
finalFocus when a flow has an external trigger or opens a second dialog.
An explicit finalFocus applies only while focus is still in the closing popup
or on the page body. If the user already moved focus elsewhere, closing leaves
it there, as the default `true` does (`ui/finalFocus.ts`, shared by Menu,
Popover and Dialog).
Editors can supply `headerActions` beside Close and `leadingActions` before the
trailing footer actions. Footer actions wrap as whole controls, never shrinking
single-line labels. When one action exceeds the available width, the footer
scrolls horizontally from a safe start edge so both ends remain reachable.
`onEscape` may return true to consume Escape for an
inline layer (such as an inspector) before dismissing the dialog. Nested modal
layers still use Dialog so Base UI owns their focus trap and dismissal order;
`placement="right"` and explicit `dismissOnOutsideClick` suit inspector sheets.
Use `size="wide"` for two-column catalogs such as Add harness. It caps the width
at 55rem and preserves viewport gutters; `height="stable"` can reserve the body
while changing catalog selection. Content-sized dialogs also scroll only their
body when viewport-capped, without reserving extra height; their title and
actions stay outside that scrollport. If enlarged title/actions alone cannot fit
the viewport, the outer dialog scrolls as a fallback so pointer access does not
depend on focusing an offscreen control. Flow bodies retain at least one control
height plus their padding, with scroll padding to reveal complete focused fields
rather than only their text selection; bounded flex/expanded bodies keep their own sizing.
Use `size="expanded"` for large reading surfaces such as code diffs, capped at 72rem;
the body scrolls while the shared title and close action remain available. This
changes only size, not modal ownership or dismissal behavior.

An optional `navigation={{ label, content }}` composes an expanded modal with one
integrated sidebar, a semantic divider and an independently scrolling detail.
Supply SidebarNavigation containing NavigationSection and NavigationItem as its
content, not a Panel or another nav element. Dialog owns the surface, insets and scrollports; do not add rounded
inner frames or cancel its padding. At narrow dialog widths the navigation wraps
above the detail in one scrollport. Dialog hands focus to content after a navigation click
when the stacked navigation would otherwise leave it offscreen. Navigation opts
into expanded geometry; do not combine it with stepped or side-inspector layouts.
Settings is the first consumer. Its sections retain their existing immediate-save
or explicit-save actions inside the content, rather than a modal-wide Save footer.

Use `text-label` (16px, 500 weight at the default scale) for the shared Dialog
title. Group the title and optional description with `--space-2` (8px), beside
the close button so its hit area does not enlarge the text gap. The body owns
vertical padding matching the dialog's horizontal `--dialog-padding`: `2rem`,
or `1rem` at viewport widths up to `30rem`. Do not add an outer flex gap
on top of that body padding. Footers following body content also reserve a fixed
`--space-4` (`1rem`) top gutter outside the scrollport, so scrolling content never
meets the buttons directly. Header-only confirmations retain their header-to-action
gap. Create/Edit channel forms opt into
`headerGap="compact"` for a 12px heading-to-body gap at every breakpoint;
other dialog compositions retain their default spacing. Their privacy confirmation
steps also opt into `footerGap="compact"` for `0.5rem` of body-bottom padding
before the fixed footer gutter; returning to the form restores the normal
body-bottom padding.
Session settings uses content height and the default footer spacing, with one
body scrollport and only the shared outer gutter below its actions.
For a bounded dialog with fixed controls above a list, use `height="stable"`
with `bodyLayout="flex"`. The body becomes a non-scrolling flex column; the
feature supplies a `flex: 1; min-height: 0` composition with fixed controls and
one flexing scrollport. Keep results and their recovery feedback reachable; Members
administration errors sit outside that scrollport, below its fixed search controls.
Without footer actions, the flex body omits its bottom padding so
only the popup supplies the outer bottom gutter. With actions, it retains the
body-to-footer spacing. The default flow layout and other dialogs remain unchanged.
The shared Dialog uses `duration-settle` and `easing-enter` for a subtle upward
fade, with `duration-fast` on exit. Base UI owns transition presence;
keep the controlled component mounted while setting `open={false}` for an exit.
Reduced motion, keyboard navigation, and Escape dismissal are immediate. Pass
`motion="none"` for frequently used surfaces such as the search palette.
Channel Create/Edit privacy and Members confirmations opt into a keyed `step`
inside that same modal. The complete surface crossfades over 200ms with 4px blur: the form grows to
1.05 while confirmation grows from 0.95 to 1; returning reverses those positions.
This explicitly requested, bounded dialog transition is an exception to the
no-blur rule below, not a new default for dialogs. One stable Base UI title and
description label the modal; outgoing content is inert and hidden from assistive
technology. Reduced motion, keyboard navigation and `motion="none"` swap steps
immediately. The caller still owns draft state and focus between steps; no second
modal, backdrop or write owner is introduced. Each centered step retains its own
height and body layout while exiting, so a stable-height Members list can switch
to a content-sized confirmation without collapsing its scrollport. Expanded and
side-sheet compositions are unchanged.


Use Accordion for collapsible sections. Plugin access declarations opt into `animate`:
Base UI owns height-transition presence with the shared settle tokens, while
`motion/react` fades the panel between states. Keyboard activation and reduced
motion switch immediately. Other accordions retain their existing behavior.
Form sections pass `keepMounted` so
collapsing them preserves local input state; leave the default for static content.
Use `variant="form"` when the surrounding form owns spacing. It removes outer
margins while keeping the shared row and panel padding. Adjacent disclosure rows
form one stack; avoid inserting form-section gaps between individual rows.
Use the proposed `section` variant for a disclosure alongside InlineHeader
groups, such as completed reminders. It shares the heading type treatment,
extends the hit area around the aligned label, and leaves panel content flush
with adjacent lists. Render counts with the same caption role as those groups.

Use Tooltip for short hints on labelled controls; use PreviewCard for richer
content. Tooltip owns its description link and inherits placement, focus and
Escape behavior from Base UI. For asynchronous action feedback (such as copying a
channel ID), control `open` / `onOpenChange` and set `closeOnClick={false}` so the
initiating click does not dismiss its result. Defaults retain ordinary hint behavior.
`follow="pointer"` attaches a compact, non-interactive hint below/right of the native
pointer using Base UI cursor tracking and collision handling; keyboard focus uses
its trigger anchor. Do not replace or hide the system cursor, spring the tracking,
or include full URLs in the pointer chip. Clipboard actions show “Copy”, then a
check and “Copied” while hovered/focused; keep screen-reader status and touch toast
feedback with the action owner. Pointer offsets clear the physical cursor silhouette
rather than following text-scale spacing. Real pointer geometry needs browser/native
inspection; DOM tests do not establish placement.
Overlay layers keep toasts, then menus and hints, above dialogs, so feedback a
dialog raises stays visible.
Adding a hint must preserve the host's keyboard contract. A focus-opened tooltip
can consume Escape before a panel's Back handler; the existing PanelSubview
controls expose this conflict. Preserve their accessible names and current Back
behavior while the shared policy is unresolved; see the
[adoption gap](../../../docs/design-system-adoption.md#gaps-to-address-when-migrating-owners)
before adding hints to these controls. This is not a general exemption from hints.
Hints use text-caption (12px / 16px), with space-1 vertical and space-2 horizontal
padding. Pointer entry uses the shared state duration (150ms), fading from a
0.97 scale, 2px downward offset and 2px blur; exit reverses it with the fast
duration (120ms). This designer-requested blur is a tooltip-specific exception.
Base UI instant states and keyboard navigation skip transitions; reduced motion
keeps only the fade.

ToastProvider mounts one headless [Sonner](https://sonner.emilkowal.ski) Toaster
in the host, portaled outside the app layout to the bottom right. Features and
plugins use the shared Toast API, never their own Toaster or direct Sonner calls.
Toast cards reuse `floating-surface`, including its `--shadow-panel` elevation; the
scrollable viewport leaves room for the shadow and keyboard focus.
Buzz owns the floating surface, semantic colors, type roles, Button and IconButton;
headless content inherits the host theme and text size without an OS-theme override.
Group title and description with `space-1` (4px), then separate actions with
`space-3` (12px). Use `space-3` padding on every card edge. The dismiss slot is
independent of the text group so its 32px hit target cannot open a gap between
title and description. It extends 8px toward the trailing edge and 4px vertically
into the padding; title-only confirmations stay centered beside it. Descriptions
use secondary text, and actions align with the message's leading edge.
The pinned Sonner patch preserves intentional focus destinations when leaving a
toast; fallback restoration still applies when focus is otherwise lost. Expiry
pauses while the stack is hovered, focused or being dragged, independently of
visual expansion, and resumes on exit. Escape dismisses the focused dismissible
notice; persistent recovery remains. Cards allow vertical touch scrolling through
the bounded stack and reserve swipe dismissal for horizontal gestures.

Sonner is the toast behavior owner; other matching controls use Base UI. ToastNotice belongs to the source that
owns its state and recovery: unmounting the source removes its notification,
without reporting user dismissal. Gate notices from hidden Settings sections
explicitly; portals do not inherit a hidden ancestor. Keep form errors and
blocked-page recovery inline. Channel LiveStatus is lasting, feature-owned recovery:
keep it in the conversation flow immediately above the composer, with bounded
overflow, so Send and companion-panel controls remain usable. Its retry policy
and diagnostics belong to Channels; it does not enter the floating toast stack.

Use `useToastNotification` for completed-action feedback that must outlive its
source row (such as copying profile metadata); the host stack owns its finite
expiry. Keep source-owned recovery on ToastNotice.

Use a finite timeout for transient feedback. Recovery defaults to no expiry and
no dismissal unless the source supplies onDismiss; preserve all recovery actions.
The expanded, bounded, scrollable stack keeps every recovery action available.
It sits at the bottom right with safe-area insets, including narrow windows; do
not add feature-specific top offsets. F6 enters notifications, Tab reaches actions. Modals
remain above the stack. Content updates do not restart expiry; timeout changes do.

Tabs with content use renderPanel, which lets Base UI connect each tab and panel.
Route navigation uses NavigationItem with aria-current instead, except for the
wide shell topbar described below. Tabs can also
compose NavigationItem through the `navigation` variant: these retain tab
semantics, hug their contents up to a 12rem maximum with ellipsis, use 18px corners matching adjacent icon
actions, and a subtle selected fill, accept avatars/icons, and place a sibling close
button over reserved trailing space. Tab close icons use 1rem artwork to match
container header actions while retaining their compact hit areas. Close buttons stay visible on the active tab; inactive tabs reveal them on hover or keyboard focus. Touch devices keep close buttons visible. Navigation tab strips scroll only horizontally. Their rounded thumb uses the sidebar’s quiet scrollbar role, with a 3px visible thumb in the header’s 4px bottom inset. The tab row keeps its vertical position as overflow starts or stops. It appears only while the strip is hovered; touch devices retain the thumb without requiring hover. The main
channel header uses the same control with a single non-closable tab with `showSelection={false}` (no selection or hover fill); channel
actions remain in the header action slot. The settings launcher uses
`data-highlight-expanded="false"` to preserve disclosure semantics without a
sticky pressed treatment; the selected tab owns the open-state indicator.
Reopening an existing thread increments its navigation tab's `attentionRequest`:
the tab briefly uses `affordance-subtle-pressed`, then returns to its selected
fill. The shared tab owns this paint-only cue and reveals an overflowed tab
without moving focus. Repeated openings restart only the cue; mounting retained
tabs and ordinary selection do not replay it. Reduced motion holds the tint
briefly and removes it without fading.

NavigationItem
offers an `option` variant for picker rows with even 8px padding and immediate
hover feedback. It forwards normal button events, refs and data attributes so unread observation,
preloading and product shortcuts remain with the caller.
`multiline` lets a stacked navigation label grow with its content. Use
`NavigationCard` when a destination has supporting detail or separate sibling
controls: the primary NavigationItem owns focus and `aria-current`, while the
card owns the shared hover and selected surface. Put details in its `footer`,
not inside the primary button. Nested destinations keep their own selection.
Use `tone="tonal"` for task trees: the shared card uses neutral selected and hover
surfaces. Use `tone="inset"` for a lead destination whose own hover, focus, menu,
and selection use `surface-inset`. Both tones rest transparent, including open
cards. A contained active branch clears its enclosing cards' fill and border.
Own row hover, focus, or menu can paint over contained selection; that enclosure
has one uniform surface until a contained interaction takes priority. A Solo
card's `dropTarget` uses `affordance-sidebar-hover` across its full enclosure;
it takes priority over selection and clears contained card fills while active.
Put nested destinations in `body`. Solo destinations keep worker disclosures in
`footer` by default; show their summary only while that task or a worker is
selected. Use `disclosure.placement="leading"` for an always-visible,
icon-only sibling beside its primary button.
Use `disclosure.placement="trailing"` for an independent caret immediately after
the project title. Only the caret toggles the container; the title and supporting
metadata navigate to the project chat. Own-row hover, keyboard focus, or menu
interaction reveals the caret; expansion alone does not. More stays at the row
end, aligned with the same status column as ordinary tasks.
Keep the worker body mounted and its saved expansion state. Footer disclosures
put the caret at the inline end:
closed rows show worker avatars; hover, expansion, or keyboard focus replaces the
avatars with the caret. Worker rows and their summary add no hierarchy indentation.
Solo task headings use `text-body-sm`; workers use `text-caption`, and inset
project headings use `text-label`. Task and worker supporting text uses
`text-caption`; project rollups keep `text-body-sm`. Footer summary text and its
caret use the unselected row role `text-navigation` and align to the inline start.
Worker status glyphs are 12px; task and project glyphs remain 14px. Worker unread
counts appear in the summary; retain accessible row unread evidence without
painting a dot. Task and project unread dots stay in the card's trailing flow,
separate from status text and the overflow action.
Selected rows can expand without painting the entire branch in the accent color.

Its `text` variant is a text-only row action, such as a capped list's Show
more and Show less: the base navigation item's type and padding with no fill, resting in
`--text-subtle` and strengthening to `--text-standard` on hover and keyboard
focus. Use it where a fill would read as another destination.

PreviewCard may expose supplemental actions through `actionRef`, such as copying
an identity's full npub. Focus opens every preview at once, so immediate Tab
navigation reaches the action; hover still waits for the pointer to rest. They remain non-modal and never take focus on hover. When no side has enough room,
action previews shift within the viewport to keep their controls reachable. Tab
from the trigger reaches the first focusable item, including a pausable status ticker.
Tab moves through the supplemental actions in document order. Shift+Tab from the
first item returns to the trigger; Tab from the last continues after the trigger. Escape dismisses the preview before restoring focus,
but never pulls focus back if the user moved it during exit. Closing previews
are no longer Tab destinations or pointer targets.
Scrolling anything that contains the trigger dismisses a hover-opened preview when
the trigger moves: a still pointer cannot report that its trigger moved away. A
scroll that leaves the trigger in place, such as scroll anchoring, keeps the
preview. A hover close is refused while the pointer is still on the trigger: a
scrolling virtualized list briefly stops hit-testing, and WebKit then reports a
mouseleave that the pointer never made. A keyboard-focused
trigger keeps its preview, hidden while the trigger is scrolled out of view
unless focus is inside it.
The positioned portal owns its layer above dialogs. An optional content anchor
keeps previews near compact identity content inside wider actionable rows. Identity
previews prefer above that content (with Base UI collision handling), leaving
the hovered row’s trailing action unobstructed.

## Menu row corners

Menu rows use `--floating-inner-radius` in every position, including grouped
choices and submenu triggers. Default and wide menus derive 19px inner corners
from their 24px surface; compact menus derive 11px from their 16px surface.
Both include the 4px padding and 1px border in the inset.

Use these shared recipes. Do not add positional or feature-local radius overrides,
derive another inset formula, or change the global row radius for one menu.

## Align row content, not state backgrounds

When composing NavigationItem lists inside dialogs or padded panels, align the
leading content column with the heading. With icons, this means the icon slot;
labels form a second consistent column. Give mixed icons and identity fallbacks
the same slot (24px in the page search palette), retaining each
icon's intended size within it.

The hover and selected backgrounds may extend beyond that content edge. Offset
the list wrapper by the existing `--space-control-inset` rather than removing
NavigationItem padding, moving the heading, or overriding the row's paint. The
surrounding composition owns this offset; it is not a global navigation change.

Preserve at least `--space-2` of outer gutter. At the dialog's compact breakpoint
(480px), its padding is 16px, so reduce the outward offset from 16px to 8px. That
small content inset is intentional: the row background and keyboard focus must
stay clear of the dialog edge. Scrollable lists also need space inside their
scroll container for the focus outline; account for that space in the offset.
Align empty-state text with the same leading content column.

Check the composition with no highlighted row, hover, selection and keyboard
focus, in both themes and at narrow widths and enlarged text. Content alignment
should remain legible without a state background to explain it.

## State

Define default, hover, pressed, focus, selected, disabled, and loading states where
they apply. Keep the same control recognizable across those states.

- Pressed changes the fill without moving the control.
- Loading preserves the label’s space and blocks repeated activation in behavior, not just CSS.
- For initial reads and non-blocking background checks, use [Loading without flicker](#loading-without-flicker): delay progress feedback for one second, never content. User-triggered writes such as Save still show immediate loading feedback.
- Hover adds contrast appropriate to the surface: a light row darkens, while a dark chip may lighten.
- Selection remains visible after the pointer leaves. A selected toggle-group item does nothing when selected again and has no hover treatment.
- Disabled means unavailable. Do not use it as a quieter text-emphasis level.
- Keep a way to recover visible even when a state assumption or visibility rule is wrong.

## Emphasis

Use three text levels: primary content, supporting text, and metadata. Primary
and supporting text should carry most of the interface. If you need more hierarchy,
first adjust size, weight, position, or grouping rather than adding a fourth color.

Name borders for their purpose: quiet separation, control boundaries, or focus.

## Type

Use complete type roles when building a screen. The raw ramps (`--type-size-*`,
`--type-leading-*`, `--type-tracking-*`, `--type-weight-*`) supply values; roles combine
them into Tailwind utilities such as `text-body`. Both live in `styles/typography.css`.

Color and type roles use separate namespaces. Color registers as `--color-*`; type
registers as `--text-*`. For example, `text-standard text-body` combines a color with a
complete type setting.

The active sizes are 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 24, 28, 32, 36, 44, 56, 72 and 96px
at 100% interface size. Sans roles use Inter and mono roles use JetBrains Mono.
Values scale with the host interface-size preference.

- Components use named roles, never private primitive sizes. The viewer shows
  each utility’s semantic role and complete setting alongside the size ladder.
- A role carries size, leading, tracking and weight together. Display, title,
  and heading roles use unitless 1.1 leading so wrapped headings have breathing room.
- Regular (400) is for reading and form labels; Medium (500) is for actions and
  structure. Existing `font-semibold` consumers resolve to Medium.
- Mono uses `detail/body-xsmall` at 12/16 with 0.03em tracking.
  `--type-xsmall-size` points to the existing 12px step, keeping the semantic
  independent from caption even though their sizes currently match. `text-mono-lg` and
  `text-mono-sm` are compatibility aliases for this same setting, not extra sizes.
- Caption uses 12/16 and 0.0133em tracking. Buzz’s `text-body` uses 14/20; `text-label` uses 16/24 and `text-body-lg` uses 20/28.
- Message prose uses `text-message`: 14px with 1.625 leading (22.75px at
  default), matching Berd’s relaxed reply rhythm for both sent and received
  messages. The message renderer uses `space-4` between prose blocks, with
  `space-2` between an introductory paragraph and its following list. Labels,
  controls, code, tables and headings retain their existing type roles.
- Preserve text preferences and browser zoom. Author values in scaled rem and
  keep layout geometry independent of text scaling.

Typography provenance: the ramp and role settings derive from the pinned
[Block UI typography
specification](https://github.com/squareup/design-blockinterface/blob/eff766161ba8aaee3258ca107f0d904dd542c708/blockUI/docs/type.resolution.draft.json).
The values documented above define this system, including the 12px xsmall role.

## Both modes

Design and inspect light and dark mode together. Elevation, glass, and accent text
need their own values in each mode.

- Accent text is darker than its fill on light surfaces and lighter on dark surfaces.
- Tints are pale in light mode and deep in dark mode; their names describe their purpose.
- Check text with its actual fill and backdrop, including interactive states.
- The original design exploration was light-only. Buzz’s dark values are authored choices and should be revised when rendered evidence shows a problem.

Received message bubbles use `bubble-received`, slightly stronger than quiet
control fills. Reply connectors and thread spines use `border-message-thread`
to remain visible on conversation surfaces in both modes.

### Accent color

One device-local accent choice colors message bubbles and their related content,
the composer Send button, and sidebar row hover/selection. General buttons,
checked controls, segmented filters, tabs, menus, and links outside bubbles keep
their neutral appearance. Solo card drop destinations use the sidebar hover tint;
other drag indicators stay neutral. Status colors, focus, categorical
purple, shadows, and media-specific roles stay independent.

**Chillin’** (the default) uses soft accent fills for your messages; **Buzzin’**
uses solid accent fills with the family's reading ink. Received bubbles stay
neutral at both levels. Vibe changes bubble
contrast only: sidebar rows keep a solid selected fill with paired ink and a
quieter hover at both levels, and Send keeps a strong accent fill.
Saved low or retired quiet contrast maps to Chillin’; high remains Buzzin’.

Keep appearance decisions with the existing owners. `SidebarNavigation` scopes
`surface-sidebar-selected`, `text-sidebar-selected`, `affordance-sidebar-hover`,
and `text-sidebar-hover` to its row states. General navigation and tabs keep the
neutral `surface-navigation-selected` / `text-navigation-selected` pair.
The message renderer uses standard text on received bubbles, with
`text-message-link` for their links and
`text-message-link-own` for outgoing bubbles. Neutral code/table insets retain
their own link pairing. The composer uses the existing `accentButtonStyle` on
Send; other prominent actions use the neutral prominent roles.

Reuse the existing twelve-step ramps in each mode. Keep the fill and its paired
ink together. Never recolor the whole shell. Nested dark scopes resolve their
own ramp. Media pixels, the black viewing canvas, and white-on-dark media glass
never follow the accent.

Swatches and their tooltips preview each family's strong fill and paired
`text-on-accent` ink. They carry `data-accent` and `data-color-mode`.
Appearance uses compact Mode and Vibe level Selects with a live illustrative
preview. Do not mix colors or use opacity to invent lighter shades.


## Density and rhythm

Choose the content structure first: a list, reading column, gallery, settings
group, or workspace. Use generous space by default, with tighter relationships
inside a group than between groups.

- Dense data uses edge-to-edge rows and dividers where a line helps track the row.
- Distinct swatches, type samples, and avatars often need only space between them. Avoid adding a card or divider when the content already separates itself.
- Show samples on the surface where they will be used. Glass needs a backdrop; a white swatch on white needs a quiet boundary.
- Cards group widgets, gallery items, or settings. They sit on `bg-panel` with spacing or a hairline and have no default fill. Use `bg-hover` only for an interactive card’s hover state. There is no `bg-card` role; `bg-inset` is for recessed content such as inputs or code blocks.
- Use native thin scrollbars: `scrollbar-width: thin` and `scrollbar-color: var(--scrollbar-thumb-quiet) transparent`. Use the sidebar’s subtle gray thumb in both modes. Load the shared recipe into vendor shadow roots and let the browser control scrolling and visibility.

## Motion

Use motion to explain a change in state, position, or structure. Remove animation
that adds no useful information.

### Activity dots

`TypingDots` owns the shared decorative activity motion. `state="waiting"`
breathes all three dots together over 2.4 seconds for a received request waiting
to start. `state="working"` (the default) preserves the 1.4-second staggered fade.
Switching state keeps the same footprint. These named component rhythms are
continuous status motion, not the short state-transition durations.

The feature must supply reliable receipt/work evidence; rendering the waiting
variant does not establish that an agent received a message. Keep visible or
accessible state text with the owning surface. The dots are hidden from assistive
technology and stay static under reduced motion, so motion alone must never be
the only way to distinguish lifecycle states. The component viewer includes both
states and an interactive transition. Agents2 waiting/working presentations reuse
these states in messages, thread summaries and navigation.

Direct manipulation follows the pointer without easing. Apply settling motion
after release, and prevent a drag from selecting text it passes over.

Keep blur fixed during general surface transitions; animate opacity instead.
The form dropdown, menu, popover, and tooltip sections document narrow,
designer-requested blur exceptions. Respect each component’s keyboard and
reduced-motion treatment.

## Colour structure

The palette supplies values. Semantic roles name their purpose. Components and
screens consume those roles so one shared edit can change every caller.

| Layer | Example | Used by |
|---|---|---|
| **Palette** | `--purple-9`, `--neutral-4` | Shared token definitions; each hue has authored light and dark steps. |
| **Roles** | `--surface-panel`, `--text-danger`, `--affordance-subtle-hover` | Component recipes and product screens. |
| **Components** | Button, Input, Dialog | Product features that need the same appearance and behavior. |

Choose a role by its job, even when it uses the same palette step in both modes.
Add roles for real uses and their required states; document the intended surfaces
and paired text. Do not generate unused role families from every palette hue.
Existing palette utilities and older role names are compatibility APIs while
callers migrate, not the default for new UI. Tailwind's stock palette is removed.

`ShimmerText` gives a short live-work label (an agent's current step) a slow
sheen between the subtle and standard text roles. Use it only while that work is
live, never on finished, failed or waiting text. Reduced motion shows plain text.

Activity indicators that appear while work is live (the message activity pill,
thread-summary dots, sidebar working badge) use the `buzz-arrive` recipe.
Inline indicators beside text get a quiet fade at `--duration-state`.
Standalone pills add `data-arrive="grow"`: they open their space while fading
in, with `--duration-settle` and `--easing-settle`, so content below moves
instead of jumping. When work ends, the owner may set `data-leaving` and keep
the pill mounted until its animation finishes; it fades and closes its space.
Growing and closing resize the row for a few frames, so reserve them for
indicators that start and end with work, never for revoked access. Reduced
motion disables all of it.

### Changing a color

Change a semantic mapping when one job needs a different value. Change a palette
step when its value is wrong for all roles that share it. Measure the actual
pairings in both themes; a numbered step alone does not guarantee contrast.
For example, warning boundaries use amber-11 in light mode and amber-9 in dark,
because the lighter amber steps cannot identify a control against a light panel.

Palette values are based on Radix Colors (MIT), with authored neutral ramps and
documented adjustments in `tokens.css`. These are values, not a component or
behavior dependency. Base UI remains the component behavior layer, with Sonner owning Toast.

### Naming and usage

Use purpose, emphasis and state: `surface-panel`, `text-subtle`, `border-danger`,
`affordance-prominent-pressed`. Text and border roles register in their own
Tailwind namespaces so a border cannot accidentally inherit a text color.

- Use `text-danger` for error text and pair it with the documented surface.
- Add a categorical role when a feature needs to distinguish identities by hue.
- Chart marks use `chart-series-1` to `chart-series-4` in that order, following
  the entity rather than its rank, so filtering never repaints a series. Fold a
  fifth series into “Other”. Labels, values and legends keep text roles; a swatch
  beside them carries the identity.
- Keep transparency in shared material recipes. Do not dim tokens locally.
- Author both light and dark values; do not derive one by dimming the other.
- When two roles share a decision, reference the same token rather than copying a literal.

## Contrast

Buzz checks opaque text pairs against both **WCAG AA (4.5:1)** and its existing
**APCA** targets: Lc 60 for body/UI text and Lc 45 for metadata. Small metadata
still needs the normal-text WCAG ratio. Control and state boundaries use the
separate WCAG 3:1 non-text ratio; decorative separators and hover fills do not.

- **Use both measurements.** The ratio establishes the AA floor; APCA adds a
  polarity-aware readability check. A perceptual pass alone does not establish
  WCAG conformance, and a numeric pass does not replace rendered inspection.
- **Adjust the fill to support readable text.** If neither black nor white is legible on a solid fill, change its lightness while preserving the hue.
- **Derive paired text from its fill.** Generate `text-on-*` with the fill instead of setting it independently.
- **Share the pairing logic.** Desktop, mobile, and web use one implementation.
- **Size a text step against the worst surface it can land on**, including
  hover, pressed and selected fills. A step that only clears a panel at rest
  can fail when a menu row highlights.
- **Dark mode is not light mode inverted.** APCA is polarity-asymmetric:
  light-on-dark needs more separation than the same WCAG ratio suggests. The
  dark ramp's text steps are therefore lighter than a mirrored ramp would put
  them — steps 9 and 10 sit above where linear spacing would.
- **`text-disabled` is deliberately below target.** Low contrast is the signal
  that a control is unavailable. Never put information a person needs there.
- **`pnpm design:check` enforces this.** Every text role is measured against
  every surface it can sit on, in both modes, parsed from `tokens.css` so the
  check cannot drift from the tokens. Keep exceptions in the owning guard with a stated reason.
- **Check identity text on tint hover.** Measure its `text-*` role against the highlighted tint as well as its resting surface.
- **Decorative dividers have no contrast target.** WCAG’s 3:1 non-text requirement applies to boundaries needed to identify a control or state. Keep quiet grouping lines distinct from required control boundaries.
  Error and warning boundary roles must reach 3:1 against surface-base,
  surface-panel, surface-inset and surface-popover in both themes. The contrast
  guard checks these role mappings and status dots separately from text and
  decorative dividers.

Text selection uses `surface-text-selection` with `text-on-selection`, including
composer tokens. Its neutral fill must remain distinct from app, panel, and
received/own bubble backgrounds at both vibe levels and in both themes. Own
bubbles use the `-own` pair, reversing the solid bubble’s ink and fill at Buzzin’.

### Link contrast

General inline links use the neutral `text-link` and a persistent underline.
Mention chips retain their resting fill instead of an underline. Bubble links use the family’s
readable `text-message-link` at both vibe levels. Own messages use `text-message-link-own`, which pairs with that
level's bubble fill. Components consume the matching link role;
never pick a link color per component.

Mentions are people, not destinations, so they are chips rather than links.
Spend the accent on mentions of you, not on mentions in general: ordinary
mentions repeat in almost every message, so they stay a neutral chip
(`text-mention` on `affordance-mention`) at every level, matching the composer.
A mention of you asks for your attention and joins the strong group:
`text-mention-self` on `affordance-mention-self`, the prominent fill and its ink
in light mode, and a neutral chip with the prominent mark as ink in dark mode,
where fills stay neutral. Inside your own bubble the `-own` pair wins; on the
solid accent bubble (at Buzzin’) it is tone-on-tone: a deeper step of the bubble's fill with the bubble's ink, deeper again on hover. System notices
name people as quiet text, never as chips.

These pairs have no link-specific contrast exemptions.
The contrast guard checks APCA and WCAG AA (4.5:1) on opaque text pairs, including
hover and pressed fills. Metadata uses neutral 9 (#5f5f5f) in light mode so small
labels remain readable even on the pressed neutral 4 surface.

### Quiet surface stack

In dark mode the panel is #1a1a1a, inset #101010, subtle control #232323,
popover #282828, ordinary control hover #2e2e2e, and floating row hover/ordinary
selection #333333. Floating controls and selection use #404040, with control
hover #595959 and press #737373. The popup separates from the panel without
consuming the ordinary control hover range.
In light mode panels and popovers remain white, inset/control fills #f5f5f6,
control hover #f1f1f2, floating row hover #f5f5f6, ordinary selection #e8e8e8,
and floating selection #dadada.
Borders stay decorative unless needed to identify a control or state.

### Relative sizing

Use rem for authored UI dimensions and spacing, semantic roles for text, and
unitless line-height. Dimensions are based on a 16px root at the default interface size.
The host interface-size preference scales the root, so text, numeric icons and
rem layout spacing grow together. Keep physical hairlines, optical offsets, and runtime
geometry returned by the browser or media APIs in pixels. Sidebar resize limits
and its 650px navigation breakpoint remain paired with their JavaScript owner;
the timeline measures its rem-sized leading region for Virtua's pixel start margin.

## Writing

Use direct, familiar language and remove words that do not help someone decide or act.

- Labels describe the action or destination in the reader’s terms.
- Name the app destination Messages, matching navigation. Its sidebar lists two
  inventories, Solo and Team; use “Solo chats” or “Team channels” when context helps.
  Ordinary messages and message settings still refer to content, not the destination.
  These labels do not rename internal routes, plugin IDs or saved preference keys.
- Empty states explain what belongs there and provide a useful next step.
- Errors explain what happened and how to recover, beside the affected control.
- Keep names and capitalization consistent across the flow.

Pane titles name the destination (“Agents”, “Projects”); they do not carry setup
instructions or implementation details. Subtitles must add useful orientation,
not repeat the title. Put collection limits and recovery guidance next to the
affected content. For example, “Showing up to 100 projects and repositories” is
appropriate only if the limit counts displayed objects. Projects currently limits
announcements before grouping/deduplication, so use “Showing a partial list from
up to 100 announcements.” Preserve what the limit actually counts. Explain technical
distinctions only when they change what someone can find or do.

Use concise, verb-first action names in buttons, menus, and icon hints. Switching
from a labelled button to an icon must preserve the action's accessible name.
Keep the same term across the trigger, dialog, and result. Empty-state actions
may use text buttons even though pane-header actions are icon-only.

## Accessibility

Give every interactive element an accessible name, with one owner for each label.
Use paired text roles on colored surfaces and verify the rendered contrast.

Keep keyboard, pointer, and shortcut paths consistent. When adding an input handler,
identify and check every supported way to reach the action.

The intended focus recipe requires both `html[data-keyboard-navigation]` and
`:focus-visible`. The app-root modality owner supplies the attribute; pointer
focus stays quiet, including programmatic focus during a drag. Shared text
fields replace the ring with a perimeter stroke; see
[Focus appearance](#focus-appearance) rather than adding a
local replacement.

Pair color with text, shape, or position. Solid avatar status badges are an explicit
product exception, including the light Away badge’s accepted contrast shortfall.
Preserve their fills and expose known status through the owning accessible label
or description. See [Identity shapes](#identity-shapes).

## Responsiveness

Check narrow, intermediate, and wide layouts, including enlarged text and browser
zoom. Use relative units for readable content so the interface respects the
person’s size preference. Allow content to reflow before it clips.

## Growing the system

1. Use an existing component before assembling its appearance yourself.
2. Choose a semantic role by purpose. Add a state sibling when the actual control needs it.
3. Keep each new role paired in both modes, document it in the token registry, and check contrast.
4. Fix shared decisions in their owner. Do not cancel shared styles from a feature stylesheet.
5. Keep layout, media geometry, editor semantics and data behavior with their product owner.

## Components

Reuse and compose existing components before adding another.

- **Behavior:** inspect Base UI before building an interactive shared component. Use its matching primitive for focus, keyboard behavior, positioning, portals, and dismissal. Buzz owns appearance and product semantics. Toast uses Sonner as documented above. Use native elements where Base UI has no matching primitive or the component is static.
- **Variants:** add a missing visual variant for a real use and mark it proposed. Do not cancel several existing states to force an unsuitable variant to fit.
- **Props:** use named variants for visual differences, never a new boolean appearance prop. Keep data and behavior props distinct from appearance choices.
- **Ownership:** keep a component with its first feature. A second real use can justify proposing it as shared.
- **Focus recipes:** require `html[data-keyboard-navigation]` and `:focus-visible` on the control. Do not rely on a base-layer reset to override component-layer styles, and do not add a `:focus-within` ring around a container that already has a control recipe. Where a scrolling list would clip an offset ring, inset it with `outline-offset: -2px` instead of shrinking it. Shared fields and the composer follow the exceptions documented above.

## Using the system

Choose a component and a role by their purpose:

| Need | Shared role or owner |
| --- | --- |
| Page background | `surface-base` |
| Panel or card surface | `surface-panel` |
| Popup | `surface-popover` |
| Recessed region | `surface-inset` |
| Control states | Affordance roles |
| Labels and reading text | Text roles |
| Edges | Border roles |

When a shared role fails in context, measure its supported surfaces and repair the
shared decision. Do not substitute a palette step in one feature. For example,
`border-primary` uses neutral-4 in light mode and neutral-6 in dark so its quiet
boundary remains visible on both page surfaces.

A role names a purpose even when it uses the same palette step in both modes.
Repeated visual treatments belong in the system. If a real design exposes an
unsuitable rule, explain the conflict and improve the rule rather than working
around it locally.

## Icons

Tabler is the only general icon family. Import named icons from `icons/index.ts`,
which re-exports individual upstream modules. Add exports as needed; no approval list.
SVG-only widgets use individual assets through `icons/svg.ts`. Do not import the
upstream packages elsewhere or reintroduce other icon libraries. Outline icons use
Tabler’s default stroke width of 2; explicit `strokeWidth` and filled exports remain
designer choices, with no size-to-stroke or selection-to-fill rules. Existing bold
uses have `strokeWidth={2.5}`; video play/pause controls use explicit filled icons.
Keep the public gateway names stable. For chat and conversation metaphors, use
`ChatCircleIcon` / `ChatsCircleIcon` (Tabler’s MessageCircle / Messages), choosing
the variant that matches the meaning. Keep accessible names on controls and
decorative artwork hidden from assistive technology.

`RobotIcon` is the designer-approved **Soft & wide** custom agent mark, using the
**Fuller canvas** refinement: a larger rounded head, short antenna, narrow ear
strokes moved inward to meet the head, and filled dot eyes, with no mouth. The
artwork fills more of the same icon box without widening the ears or adding fill
between them and the head. It uses Tabler's 24-unit canvas, round caps and default
stroke width of 2. Use the
existing gateway export for agent mentions, navigation and placeholders; retain
its inherited color, relative sizing and decorative-by-default semantics. This
is a specific product-mark exception, not another general icon family.

OneDrive is a designer-approved custom brand mark: its complete outline is recreated on
Phosphor’s square canvas, uses the same current-color and sizing behavior, and stays in
the shared icon gateway. It does not permit another general icon library.

Agent-type provider marks follow the same single-owner path. Keep approved artwork
in `icons/HarnessLogos.tsx` (with colocated raster assets when needed), record its
provenance in `NOTICE.md`, and export it through `icons/index.ts` with custom-icon
metadata. The registering agent type references that export once through
`AgentType.icon`; host-owned selectors render the registered mark and never rebuild
a provider-to-icon map from type IDs.

### Picker search and choices

Mention and media pickers opt into `SearchField variant="capsule"`. Its shared
`search-field.css` recipe also styles Emoji Mart inside its shadow root: body-sm
typography, pill radius, standard panel fill, Tabler icons, and a 32px clear
action. Other SearchField callers retain the default field treatment. Scrolling
picker results use the opt-in `buzz-thin-scrollbar` native scrollbar recipe.

Mention choices use `NavigationItem variant="option"` with 8px padding and
immediate hover/focus feedback. The picker owns arrow-key navigation and exact
identity selection; rows retain ordinary button semantics.

### Chrome route navigation

For full-page destinations, compose native-button `NavigationItem variant="pill"`
inside `nav.chrome-navigation`. It shares the chrome tab material and selected fill
but keeps normal Tab/Enter and `aria-current="page"` semantics. Do not give route
buttons a tablist/tabpanel relationship when selection moves focus to main content.
The wide shell topbar is the deliberate exception: global destinations use
`Tabs variant="chrome"` linked to the retained, labelled page panel. Arrow keys
move focus without selecting; Enter, Space or pointer selection changes the page
while focus stays on its tab. The host passes per-opening focus intent so page
autofocus does not override that handoff. Explicit content openings, including
New conversation, retain their destination focus. This is not a general route-tab
recipe: toolbar destinations and More pages overflow retain button semantics.
Messages represents the containing area for registered sidebar/default-placement
pages, while their sidebar selection and route remain exact. Its tab stays linked
to the active child panel. The shell opts into Tabs' `onReselect` to return from a
child to Messages without changing ordinary active-tab behavior elsewhere. More
pages marks that containing area with `aria-current="true"`, reserving `page` for
an exact destination. Settings and independent header pages stay separate.

The shell owns responsive overflow. Full-page `IconButton variant="chrome"` uses
`aria-current="page"` for selection; companion toggles continue to use `aria-expanded`.

### Artwork actions (proposed)

`SurfaceButton` uses Base UI activation and the shared keyboard-only focus ring.
Use it for artwork tiles whose content owns their geometry, such as new-agent
and avatar choices. It adds no label wrapper, padding, or background; callers
must supply an accessible name and keep state colors semantic. The Button
viewer includes enabled and disabled examples.

### Chip and title fields (proposed)

`Combobox.Control appearance="chip"` drops the field's surface and browse
button, so an editable choice reads as a compact label. Keyboard focus keeps a ring.
`Input appearance="title"` sets its value at title size with no field around it,
for a name that is also the heading, such as the new agent's name. It keeps
the field border transparent at rest and uses the shared perimeter stroke on focus.

Proposed: `InputGroup surface="panel"` uses the panel fill for image URL entry
on a contrasting modal surface, retaining the shared field focus treatment.

Proposed: `Dialog chromeSpacing="padded"` keeps a 12px bottom gutter on the
fixed header and a footer top gutter matching the modal bottom padding. The
body omits its vertical gutters; agent creation uses this for scrolling steps.

### Form-label and picker additions

Field labels, choice labels, PreferenceRow titles and Switch labels use the complete
`text-body-sm` role (14px, Regular). `Field optional` appends “Optional” in the
same role with `text-metadata` color and normal word spacing, including in the
accessible label. Required validation
remains the control's responsibility. Use `FieldButton dropdown={false}` for a
system picker, not a dropdown; its single-line value ellipsizes.

`SettingsGroup layout="cards"` gives each child a separate bordered surface and
a shared small gap, rather than drawing dividers across one group. Feature owners
may bound a card list's height and scrolling without repainting its cards.

### Global search presentation

The global search palette uses `Dialog presentation="search"`: an accessible,
visually hidden title, no header or close button, equal 12px top and side insets,
and the composer panel surface. Keep outside-click dismissal and Escape enabled.
Its `SearchField variant="palette"` uses a transparent fill and border with no shadow. Keyboard focus
uses a single perimeter border. It retains
24px vertical and 12px horizontal padding, and the complete 20px `body-lg` role. Both surfaces use smooth (`squircle`)
corners where supported; the input radius is the 32px modal radius minus the 12px
outer inset, giving 20px. The body retains top padding inside its scrollport for the focus stroke.
Other dialogs and search fields retain their existing presentation.

The palette omits the magnifying glass and uses the subdued “Search...” placeholder.

Search result rows use `NavigationItem variant="search"`, with 12px vertical
and horizontal padding and 21px icons. Their 20px radius follows the modal radius minus
the 12px gutter, and their hover surfaces align with the input.

Inline search settings use the search variant of PreferenceRow with a gear icon and the same title/subtitle hierarchy as destination rows. Results height transitions for 180ms, disabled with reduced motion. The clear control reserves space to keep input dimensions stable.

### Conversation identity icons (proposed)

Proposed pending designer sign-off, as a narrow exception to the chat and
conversation icon rule under Icons. Use `ChatCircleIcon` for a Solo chat in navigation, headers, tabs and chat cards.
Use `MessageReplyIcon` (Tabler MessageReply) for thread tabs, thread links and
Reply actions. Keep private Team channels' lock icon; privacy alone does not
replace a Solo chat's identity icon. Accessible chat cards end with a right
chevron. Unavailable chat cards retain a lock and unavailable accessible text;
unknown access does not earn a chevron. Display chat cards as **Chat:**, while
accepting legacy **Session:** and **Session ·** authored links without rewriting
historical messages or their receipts.
