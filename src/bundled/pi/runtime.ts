// Turns Agents deliveries into Pi turns. Every Pi agent here runs in the one
// Pi host (pi.ts), each with its own Pi durable storage, where each Buzz
// conversation is one Pi conversation. A delivery becomes a prompt in the
// harness format, submitted to its conversation; one that arrives while Pi
// works steers the run. A watch or timer runs as a standalone turn
// (`runOnce`), in a one-off conversation. Pi acts in Buzz with the in-process
// Buzz tools, signed by the agent's native-held key. The runtime reports a
// turn that fails; what Pi writes without `send` stays in local activity.
