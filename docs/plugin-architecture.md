# Plugin architecture

## Purpose

Buzz should make it practical for people and agents to build new product experiences with code. A designer should be able to build an experimental Channels page using real data and useful components, without implementing relay operations. A developer experience team should be able to add rich integrations to conversations without owning the surrounding application. And end customers of buzz should be able to extend the installed app dynamically, without having to contribute upstream or run the dev server.

Plugins are the unit of contribution and installation. They can contain substantial implementations: several components, their own layout and interactions, and multiple contributions. The foundation is ordinary React components, shared data and execution capabilities, and a small number of explicit extension points.

## The first two authoring experiences

**A page (target authoring experience).** A builder creates a plugin that registers
a page, reads shared channel views, and builds a new interface. They should be able
to reuse timeline/message components or build their own, owning the complete page
implementation and its behavior and appearance. Bundled source demonstrates this composition. The conversation preview
now supplies host Composer/Message through a generated type-only author entry;
broader supported external reuse remains an [author-contract gate](status.md#open-acceptance-and-product-gates).

**Rich conversation content.** An integration plugin recognizes a link to a GitHub pull request or a native Buzz object and supplies a panel showing that object. The Channels page decides where the panel appears. Another page can display the same content in a different arrangement.

Both experiences use real session capabilities. As AI integrations become available, authors should be able to consume those capabilities without rebuilding authentication, execution, or state handling. Agents is the app's only agent system; [shared agent selection](agents.md) gives other plugins the viewer's local agents and the known inventory through `session.agentChoices`, and mentions use current channel membership. Execution and credential handling stay blocked in the disposable editor.

## Ownership

| Area | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| Application host | Startup, plugin installation and activation, page navigation, persistent channel sidebar, Settings, and recovery. |
| Page plugin | Its complete React tree, local interaction state, internal navigation, and arrangement of panels. |
| Panel plugin | Recognizing a supported target and implementing the content and interactions for that target. |
| Shared capabilities | Session state, relay access, retained data, local agents, and eventually external connections. |
| Reusable UI components | Useful rendering and interaction behavior, configured through ordinary props. |
| Cordis | Dependency availability and resource lifetime across plugin activation, replacement, and disposal. |

Bundled and local plugins use the same contribution contracts. Within the source
tree, shared implementation code remains importable without another registration
layer; this is not a promise that external artifacts can import host source paths.

### Interface composition

Owning a React tree does not require inventing its visual system. Use the
[design guide's surface recipes](../src/shared/design-system/DESIGN.md#compose-the-whole-surface)
and [contribution ownership table](../src/shared/design-system/DESIGN.md#plugin-contribution-boundaries)
before building a page, panel, Settings contribution, dialog, or menu. Establish
which host supplies the outer surface, header, scrolling, and dismissal before
adding any of them. The Settings host renders contributed content directly;
registration metadata does not supply its content heading or group layout.

Source plugins reuse shared components; external artifacts use their supported
author contract and exposed roles. This is design guidance, not a new component
SDK or automatic conformance guarantee. Keep specialized layouts and product
behavior with the plugin, while preserving shared controls, states, and host
lifecycle. The [adoption review](design-system-adoption.md#composition-review)
distinguishes reusable examples from existing gaps.


## Code arrangement

```text

features/repos/        entity route/data contracts and bounded Git read bridge
bundled/agents/        Agents page and agent types (harness plugins register theirs)
features/agents/       Agents service: saved agents, creation, deletion
features/agents/        session-owned agent inventory, choices, local agents and activity

bundled/github/         builtin GitHub panel plugin
bundled/bestie/         builtin Bestie page
bundled/inbox/          builtin Inbox page for unread conversations and mentions
```

The host composes the conversation sidebar (Solo and Team inventories) beside
independently mounted pages. Settings supplies its own modal navigation; a selected
page can replace the conversation sidebar through its optional `sidebar` contribution.
The conversation sidebar reuses session-owned roster, unread, creation and
preferences capabilities; it does not
retain a hidden Channels page or message reader. Sidebar and page render errors
have separate boundaries. A page sidebar is isolated by the same owned-contribution
boundary, so a failure falls back to a concise alert without taking down the page,
Settings, or shell. The host owns the slot, collapse state, labels, and narrow drawer;
the page owns its sidebar content and local interaction state. Sidebar presentation
helpers remain importable from `bundled/channels`; the conversation sidebar also
exposes a versioned section contribution for plugins.

Channels is the page-authoring example, not a thin registration wrapper over a
host-owned product page. Keep page-specific components, styles, interactions and tests
beside `bundled/channels/index.tsx`. New page plugins should do the same. At the
owner’s request, reusable conversation UI lives in `features/messages`: timeline,
message rows, thread panel, composer, delivery presentation and reading geometry.
Other source plugins can compose those components through ordinary props, with
internal session/destination isolation rather than caller-dependent remount keys.
Import shared capabilities through the existing relay and panel contracts; do not
create a second connection, cache or outbox inside a page. The conversation preview exposes only Composer/Message in a stable component bag;
source imports are not a versioned external SDK. See
[conversation component ownership](channels.md#reusing-conversation-ui).

## The `buzzodz` CLI

Run `pnpm buzzodz --help` from this repository, or install the standalone executable:

```sh
cargo install --locked --path crates/plugin-manager --bin buzzodz
buzzodz plugin init /tmp/my-page example.page "My page"
# Generate and pack the host-matched type-only preview once:
pnpm author:build
(cd dist-author && pnpm pack --pack-destination ..)
pnpm --dir /tmp/my-page add -D "$PWD/buzz-author-0.0.0-preview.1.tgz"
buzzodz plugin build /tmp/my-page
buzzodz plugin install /tmp/my-page/dist
buzzodz plugin enable example.page
buzzodz plugin list
```

The CLI prints readable results and reports errors with a nonzero exit code.
`disable`, `remove`, and
`rollback` take a plugin ID. New installs start disabled; updates preserve their
existing enabled state. `recover` backs up management settings and resets to
bundled defaults, preserving artifacts for reinstallation.

`--home ABSOLUTE_PATH` and `--profile NAME` precede `plugin`. The desktop and CLI
also read `BUZZODZ_HOME` and `BUZZODZ_PROFILE` (default: `default`). Match these to
target the same instance. Otherwise, the desktop keeps profiles in its own
application-data folder (`xyz.block.buzz.desktop/profiles` for the installed app,
`xyz.block.buzz.desktop.dev/profiles` for development launches). A debug CLI
(`just cli`, `pnpm buzzodz`) defaults to the development folder and a release CLI
to the installed app's. A release CLI refuses while only the pre-1.0
`dev.local.buzz.foundation` folder exists; open Buzz once to move it, or pass
`--home`. A debug CLI likewise refuses before the first `just desktop` has copied
the installed app's storage into the development folder.

```sh
BUZZODZ_PROFILE=experiment just desktop
pnpm buzzodz --profile experiment plugin list
```

`BUZZODZ_SAFE_MODE=1 just desktop` opens the shell without external pages.
Bundled pages work on web; their enabled settings are stored in that browser.
Folder and Git/GitHub loading is available in **desktop Settings → Plugins → Manage plugins**.
Choose a folder, or enter an HTTPS/SSH repository URL and optional branch/tag;
then select a built plugin subfolder and install it. New installs are disabled;
updates retain their enabled state and may run immediately. Repositories must
include built `manifest.json` + `plugin.js` artifacts—Buzz never runs project builds
or install scripts. See [import behavior and limits](#loading-from-folders-and-repositories).
Browser installation is not supported; the browser shows a desktop-only explanation.

## Emoji and reusable conversation UI

Emoji and Mentions are built-in conversation features, always loaded by the app
and absent from the optional plugin catalog. Saved `buzz.emoji` and `buzz.mentions`
enablement flags are ignored. They reuse the contribution runtime for readiness
and cleanup, retaining their contribution keys. Emoji's picker, reactions, custom
rendering and Custom emoji Settings stay available; catalog, event tags and delivery stay
session-owned. The standard composer remains shared host UI, independent of any
example plugin. Automated tests use source-only external consumer and tool fixtures
to exercise component reuse and contribution lifecycle.

## Plugin module contract

`src/bundled/channels` is a bundled example. External projects have `manifest.json`
(`id`, `name`, `apiVersion: 1`, and optional `description`/`discovery`) and an entry
point exporting
`apply(ctx)`. `ctx` is a Cordis context. External JSX plugins export
`inject = ["react", "pages"]` and obtain `const React = ctx.react` inside `apply`, then call
`ctx.pages.register({ id, title, component })` to contribute a page. A plugin may register
several pages or none. Page IDs are unique within their plugin. Add `primary: true` for a
row in the sidebar's page navigation; every active page is listed in search. Buzz supplies React
and owns the Cordis runtime (`@deepseek-ai/cordis` 4.0.2). Import their types only
in external plugins; runtime imports are rejected by the scaffold's builder.

The scaffold uses classic JSX, so normal JSX compiles against the local `React`
variable. Components in other files can be created by a factory receiving that
same React instance. Automatic `react/jsx-runtime` imports are not supported by
the current standalone module format. Older plugins using `apply(ctx, host)` must
switch to the React injectable and rebuild.

Module evaluation must be pure. Enabled plugins activate even when their page is
not selected. Register plugin resources with `ctx.effect(() => cleanup)`; these
are disposed on disable, replacement, or app teardown. React effects belong to
the visible page and clean up when navigating away. Plugin activation must finish
within ten seconds, including waiting for required services. Losing a required
service hides the plugin's pages while Cordis waits and reactivates it; each
reactivation has a fresh ten-second deadline. Failed activation is shown in Settings;
disable/enable or install a new revision to retry. Replacement waits for prior
cleanup; if cleanup stalls, restart before that plugin can activate again.

The CLI scaffolds `src/index.tsx`, a standard `vite.config.ts`, and a `pnpm build`
script that type-checks and bundles the page. `buzzodz plugin build` runs that
script; Node/pnpm are only needed for authoring, not installing or loading pages.

API v1 distributes one self-contained JavaScript module; use inline styles or
existing host classes. Separate CSS/assets are not supported. Type-check an
external source project with `pnpm exec tsc` in that directory.

The host owns navigation, Settings, loading errors, and render error boundaries.
Settings controls and CLI management do not depend on plugin activation. Updates are detected while the app
is running. A selected page remounts when its revision changes; its local React
state resets. Plugin-specific persistent data has no host API yet.

Plugins are trusted code executing in the app's JavaScript context. They are not
sandboxed: infinite loops, global changes, and external side effects cannot be
contained or rolled back by a React error boundary. Restart selects the bundled page, but enabled external plugins still activate.
Use `BUZZODZ_SAFE_MODE=1` to pause external plugins for a launch if startup freezes.
This leaves the profile’s saved enabled settings unchanged. The CLI remains usable if the UI
freezes. Loaded JavaScript module revisions remain in memory until restart.

See [foundation status and open gates](status.md) for maintained decisions,
remaining acceptance work and historical evidence.

## Starting contracts

### Conversation sidebar sections

A plugin may register a versioned `sidebarSections` contribution. Read it with
`ctx.reflect.get("sidebarSections")` instead of adding it to required `inject`;
the lookup returns `undefined` when an older host has not provided the capability. The host
renders its rows inside the existing Team sidebar using the same collapsible,
reorderable, resizable section frame as built-in
sections. It owns presentation and persists contributed section expansion and
relative order; a plugin supplies row data and actions, not another sidebar.

Each registration is owned by the plugin's Cordis scope and is removed on
disable, replacement, or teardown. Rows use an external-store snapshot and
subscription: return a stable immutable array until the data changes, then notify
listeners. `select` is a pure row-to-`OpenTarget` function used for both active
selection and opening the row. Optional
header actions are compact buttons; each has a stable id, accessible label,
icon, and callback. A render failure, including invalid rows, replaces only that
section with its unavailable state. Its Retry renders the current rows again.
Rejected row/header actions stay local to that section.

```tsx
import { createElement } from "react";

const rows = [{
  id: "today",
  label: "Today",
  count: 2,
}];
const listeners = new Set<() => void>();
ctx.reflect.get("sidebarSections")?.register({
  version: 1,
  id: "work",
  title: "Work",
  icon: "W",
  rows: {
    snapshot: () => rows,
    subscribe(listener) {
      listeners.add(listener);
      return () => listeners.delete(listener);
    },
  },
  select: () => ({ version: 1, kind: "home" }),
  actions: [{
    id: "new",
    label: "New item",
    icon: createElement("span", { "aria-hidden": true }, "+"),
    onSelect: createItem,
  }],
});
```

A plugin exports `inject` and `apply(ctx)`. Pages register with
`ctx.pages.register({ id, title, layout?, companion?, primary?, placement?, icon?, component, sidebar? })`. Panels register with
`ctx.panels.register({ id, title, matches, order?, launcher?, toolbar?, component })`. An optional `toolbar` supplies live controls beside shell search in place of the static launcher. Its lifetime stays with its plugin, and shell render failures are isolated. Huddles is the first caller. IDs are local to the
plugin; the registry adds installation identity and revision and removes the
contribution when its Cordis scope ends. `primary: true` opts a page into shell
navigation. Its optional `placement` chooses `"sidebar"` (the default), `"topbar"`
(centered text destination), or `"toolbar"` (top-right full-page icon near search).
Pages without `primary: true` remain search/deep-link-only even with a placement.
The host owns ordering, active state, responsive overflow and navigation history;
plugins do not supply header React or a second navigation stack. Placement is fixed
for a registration's lifetime. An invalid value is dropped with a page-named warning,
falling back to the sidebar without failing activation. Older hosts ignore placement
and continue to show primary pages in their sidebar.

Harness plugins register an agent type with `ctx.agents.register`. Per-agent
configuration belongs in its `tabs`; the Agents host adds Attention. An optional
`provider` contribution exposes a stable readiness snapshot, subscription,
read-only `check()` and `DialogBody`. The Agents page supplies the Providers
health submenu plus provider title, registered icon, modal framing, dismissal,
focus restoration and error boundary. The plugin body supplies Connection and,
when supported, explicit-save Defaults sections. It also marks active install or
authentication work as blocking and supplies its cancellation control. Only
active registered types appear there; plugin activation remains owned by
Settings → Plugins → Manage plugins. Provider defaults are versioned device preferences, not
agent-record migrations; blank per-agent values inherit them.

A plugin, bundled or installed, can add a tool to every agent session in the
app with `ctx.agents.addTool({ name, description, inputSchema, call })`. `call`
gets the agent's Buzz client and where it is working, so the tool acts as the
agent, as the rest of a trusted plugin's code acts as its owner. Names are
lowercase and cannot be a Buzz tool's. The tool is removed when its plugin's
scope ends, so safe mode removes installed plugins' tools.

`ctx.agents.wake(pubkey, { channel, root?, text })` wakes an agent this copy of
the app runs in one of its conversations, as a mention there would, with no
message. `root` is the thread's root event id (64 hex); leave it out for a Solo
chat. The agent is told
the text comes from the plugin, not its owner, and is data, so quote what others
wrote (comments, check output) rather than phrasing it as instructions. It
throws when this copy does not run the agent or its queue is full. Claude, Codex and Goose accept plugin wakes; Pi ignores them. Attention delivery uses a separate internal `attention` trigger in the Interest lane, accepted by all four harnesses. Its Interest instructions retain their instruction framing, while observed messages remain data. A channel-only Attention address supplies a default posting destination and allows explicit thread replies outside Solo chats.

An agent type's `run` gets the agent's handle, which publishes, reads and
uploads as the agent. For agents that act on something other than a message,
such as a call, `ctx.agents.handle(pubkey)` returns the same handle outside any
run. It does so only for agents of the calling plugin's own types, while this
copy of the app runs them, their type is not changing and their community is
live; otherwise it returns `undefined`. A handle kept from earlier fails each
call while that no longer holds, and for good once the agent's type or its
plugin is replaced, so ask for it when acting rather than keeping it. Like any type whose agents run here, the type needs `run`.

Plugins can discover active Attention source registrations through `ctx.agents.attentionProviders()`. Each entry includes its `provider` key and optional `description` and JSON-object `configExample` supplied to `addAttentionSource`. The catalog omits executable callbacks and inactive registrations; discovery tools belong in external plugins.

A source may also `present` its watches on the Agent Attention page. Given a watch and its display name, it returns the watch's kind and, optionally, an icon, a target with a subtitle, an external link, and a details component that replaces the name in the expanded row. When a provider has no `present`, or it throws, Buzz shows the watch by its name. The GitHub plugin presents pull request watches this way, linking to its comment author settings.

Each Attention source `run` receives `spawn(processId, options)` for commands using that watch's owning agent. The host binds agent identity, watch destination and run lifetime; plugins cannot select another agent or obtain the raw authenticated connection. Declare the process in `host.processes` and request `host.mcp`, plus `host.files` for tools reading local paths. Options supply arguments, working directory, environment and output callbacks.

Buzz revokes command access on return, failure, cancellation, agent stop, provider unload or community reconnection, and closes the process and its descendants. Successfully emitted output remains queued after a producer returns. The key and MCP connection stay in Buzz; commands retain the app user's operating-system privileges and can use the agent's tools while their run remains active.

```ts
ctx.pages.register({
  id: "dashboard",
  title: "Dashboard",
  primary: true,
  placement: "toolbar",
  component: Dashboard,
});
```

A page may replace the conversation sidebar while selected. Its component receives
the current read-only `OpenTarget` and, when present, shell-generated primary
Pages navigation as `children`. It supplies only its sidebar contents within the
existing sidebar slot. Wrap that content in the existing `shell-sidebar-default`
layout role to receive the default sidebar width and shell sizing constraints
(260px default width, 220px minimum, with the shell's available-width clamp). That
role provides outer slot geometry and its divider; it does not provide an inner
surface, frame, padding, or content layout. The contributor owns those details.
External authors use this CSS role and their own markup; internal source components
such as `SidebarFrame` are not part of the author SDK. The host owns the slot and
collapse/drawer interaction. A page may manage its own width preference. Pages do
not receive navigation completion authority or own routing. On wide layouts the
shell keeps its generic Show/Hide sidebar toggle; on narrow layouts the existing
Show/Hide navigation drawer, focus handoff, Escape, inert, and ARIA behavior remain
shell-owned. Pages without `sidebar` continue to
use the conversation sidebar. The host isolates sidebar rendering with
`OwnedContribution`; a throwing sidebar shows a concise alert with scrollable page
navigation inside the standard fallback frame while the selected page and shell
remain usable. A new page navigation request retries a failed sidebar without
remounting healthy sidebar state. The sidebar shares the page's admitted workspace
target and stays mounted beneath Settings; invalid destinations are not delivered
to it.

```tsx
import type { PageSidebarProps } from "@buzz/author";

function ActivitySidebar({ target, children }: PageSidebarProps) {
  return (
    <div className="shell-sidebar-default">
      <aside className="activity-sidebar" aria-label="Activity sidebar">
        <header>Activity</header>
        <p>Current destination: {target.kind}</p>
        {children}
      </aside>
    </div>
  );
}

ctx.pages.register({
  id: "activity",
  title: "Activity",
  component: ActivityPage,
  sidebar: ActivitySidebar,
});
```

Header entries move into the labelled More pages popover when they cannot fit,
including at narrow widths. Toolbar and overflow entries use native-button
navigation and `aria-current`, not companion-panel toggles. The wide topbar uses
shared chrome tabs linked to retained page panels; manual selection leaves focus
on the tab and suppresses destination autofocus. Every active page remains
searchable, regardless of its placement.

A primary page may also supply `badge`, a component the shell renders at the end
of its navigation row, such as a count of due items. The plugin owns its data and
re-rendering; the shell owns the row and placement. A badge that throws renders
nothing and leaves navigation usable. Toolbar badges are clipped to a compact
2rem × 1rem corner mark; authors should use short counts or dots there, not rich
content. The overflow popover uses ordinary labelled rows with trailing badges.
Pages without `primary` have no navigation entry, so their badge is not shown.

`notifications.register({ id, label })` adds a category with its own switch in
Settings and returns `submit({ sourceKey, target, title?, body? })`. Submissions
share the host's permission, preference, duplicate and click handling. The host
owns display text: `title` and `body` are flattened to plain text and bounded the
same way message alerts are (`title` to 128 characters; `body` as Markdown prose
to 200), so a plugin cannot send raw markup or unlimited text to the OS. Without
them the banner reads `Buzz` / `New <label>`. The host applies no age limit to
plugin submissions; the plugin decides what is still worth announcing.

A page may supply `icon`, a `data:image/<subtype>[;params],<payload>` URL; the
scheme and type match case-insensitively. Search Buzz and the page navigation
render it as a decorative image, with the generic icon when it is absent or fails
to load. Registration drops any other value with one console warning that names
the page; the page still registers and opens. Bundled pages keep their host icons.
External plugins ship no separate assets, so inline the art into `plugin.js`, for
example with a bundler `?inline` import.

A page calls `panels.resolve(target)` and renders `PanelView` with the resulting
contribution, the target string, and a close callback. Among active panels whose
matcher accepts the target, the lowest `order` wins; a throwing matcher is
skipped. Panels receive `{ target, close }` plus
optional host context. A conversation host may supply
`context: { channelId, canOpen, open }` for contextual panel-to-panel actions.
`canOpen` is advisory active-target availability; `open` re-resolves at click time
and returns false after the originating opening, channel, session or host
presentation retires. This is not a global navigation API or an access grant.
A tab's `open` replaces that tab; a channel drawer or side-column panel's `open`
opens the target as a new tab.

### Opening targets from channel plugins

Every plugin surface in a channel or thread can open a target, such as a panel
URL, with the same `canOpen(target)` / `open(target)` pair (`TargetOpener`):
panels (`context`), channel-header launchers, composer tools and accessories,
message renderers, message ⋯ action components, attachment renderers and inline
renderers. The conversation host decides placement: in Channels a panel target
opens as a side-pane tab, as if the user clicked a link to it in that message or
composer. `canOpen` is presentation only. `open` re-resolves at click time and
returns false outside a conversation host, after the contribution is removed or
after its mount retires. Link renderers keep host-owned link activation;
reaction choosers and message markers get no opener.

### Resolution order

Panels and link renderers share one rule when several match the same target.
It covers only those two: message renderers (`registerMessage`, rendered by
`MessageBody`) keep first-active-match semantics and accept no `order`.
`order` is optional and defaults to `0`; lower wins, and equal orders fall to
ascending contribution key (`pluginId/contributionId`), so activation, load
latency and disable/re-enable never decide the winner. `matches` stays boolean,
so `canOpen` is unchanged. Three bands by convention:

| Band | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `-10` | Specialises a target another plugin already handles (a richer GitHub PR view). |
| `0` | Default: the plugin is specific to the targets it matches (GitHub, Activity). |
| `100` | Catch-all or fallback: anything under a scheme or host (a website panel, a globe icon). |

Bundled catch-alls declare `100` themselves, so a third-party plugin specific to
one service wins at the default without knowing the convention. A static number
covers a plugin that is uniformly broad or specific. A plugin whose matcher already
knows which class it hit can instead supply a function, evaluated per target; a
throwing or non-finite result counts as `0`:

```ts
ctx.panels.register({
  id: "docs",
  title: "Docs",
  matches: (target) => target.startsWith("https://docs.google.com/"),
  // Previews Docs natively; embeds anything else under the host as a fallback.
  order: (target) => (/\/document\//.test(target) ? 0 : 100),
  component: DocsPanel,
});
```

Same-band overlaps between two plugins that both consider themselves specific are
not arbitrated; the key decides. Register a separate contribution per band when
one plugin needs different titles for its specific and fallback views.
Channel-header launchers use the separate public `channelContext` metadata
contract described below; launcher/fallback panels need not have either context.
A plugin that needs shared data declares `relay` in its
injection list and passes those capabilities to its components using a closure,
just as the bundled Channels page does. The conversation preview adds only the two demonstrated component surfaces.

Channels owns its selected channel and docked target. The panel view isolates
render failures and remounts on target or revision changes. Unloading a plugin
removes its contributions and closes its panel. Other pages can use these same
contracts with their own layout and local navigation.

### Bundled defaults

**Channels is the only required bundled plugin.** Bestie,
Todos and Usage are off by default. Feedback, Diff viewer, Identity
Naming, Agent Activity, Terminal, Links, GitHub, Inbox,
Repositories, Agents, Claude, Codex, Workflows, Builderlab, Hosted communities,
Membership, and Moderation are on by default, but optional. Both browser and
native catalogs declare that policy.

Solo is part of Channels, not a plugin: Solo chats are channels opened in
Messages, and Solo drafts are a Messages route. Channels requests topbar
placement and the shell presents it as Messages, the startup destination.
Saved `buzz.me` and `buzz.sessions` flags are ignored like any uninstalled owner.

Saved enabled/disabled flags win over defaults (except required Channels). Profiles
without a saved flag use the current default, so changing a default also changes
those existing profiles. There is no migration or forced reset: a browser profile that previously saved its full
plugin snapshot can retain Bestie enabled. Native profiles store per-plugin
overrides. Default-on does not promise platform support: Terminal contributes UI
only on macOS/Linux desktop; Hosted communities needs either the desktop app or
the live development broker. Disabling Membership removes its Invite to community shortcut.

Membership and Moderation share app-owned access controllers composed in
`app/services.ts` (`bundled/admin-access.ts`). Their navigation entries and the
Plugins catalog use the same verified roster or native staff probe, including
while either plugin is disabled. The catalog leaves details readable, gates only
Enable on current access, and always permits Disable. Access status remains
visible while enabled; navigation and administrative actions require verified
authority. Restoring default-on needs no migration; explicit Off remains saved.
These UI checks do not grant permissions; relay and native enforcement still apply.

Repositories is enabled by default and owns versioned, validated repository, PR
and issue page routes. Its page is absent from primary navigation. It resolves
signed metadata through the session reader and reports navigation completion only
after destination content is presented. Git browsing uses a narrow host-owned,
authenticated Git capability in the native host and development broker; plugins cannot choose a signer or
remote URL. See [entity links and limits](deep-links.md).
GitHub recognizes repository,
pull request, issue, and commit URLs and loads object details on demand. Its
manifest declares `gh api graphql --hostname github.com --input -` as a host
process, so on desktop it reads and changes pull requests as the user's
signed-in `gh` account. That allows any query or mutation the account may make;
the token stays inside `gh`. Without `gh` it reads public data only. Unsupported
URLs retain ordinary link behavior. A host-owned GitHub connection with narrower scopes, and agent
execution, remain future shared capabilities.

### Optional channel menu panels

A panel can register `channelMenu: { label, eligible(channel, session) }` for
placement in Channels → Channel actions. Channels owns the menu, selected channel,
tab geometry, focus, and close behavior; it opens the **exact active contribution**
without resolving a target matcher. Eligibility is evaluated again at activation
against the current connected session, selected non-cached channel and membership.
Disabling or replacing a plugin retires its open tab; a channel change or loss of
eligibility closes it and unmounts its archive reader. `eligible` also decides
archived-channel availability; exclude `channel.archived` if the panel writes.
Re-enabling never reopens a
stale tab. Eligibility and `channelContext` are presentation, **not authority**:
the panel must independently verify access before reading any sensitive data and
fence asynchronous reads on revocation. Channels registers **View canvas** this
way. Canvas has no separate plugin toggle; Solo,
Todos, and agents use the same session capability. Its editor keeps the channel's
draft locally, so reopening after a channel change restores it. Members of archived
channels can read Canvas and History, but cannot edit, save, or restore through the panel.
A retained unpublished draft is labeled as local; History shows the saved versions.

### Settings cards

`ctx.settingsCards.register({ id, title, icon, component })` contributes a Settings
destination under the selected community. Adding `group` places it under that
labelled navigation group instead; the existing `"App"` group appears as **Buzz**.
Adding `personal: true` also lists a community card under **Personal space**, for
cards such as Pair mobile that collect their own community address; it cannot be
combined with `group` or `section`.
Its section id is the contribution key (`plugin/card`) and disappears with the plugin. The optional `icon`
uses the shared design-system icon gateway; the host supplies a fallback when omitted.
Cards receive `active()` and use ordinary
session capabilities through injection. Host boundaries isolate rendering errors;
exact registration identity and mounted lifetime revoke callbacks on removal.

The channel template extension point (`ctx.channelTemplates`) was removed with the
v1 Agents system. The host sidebar owns channel groups and the existing + creation
buttons. Channel templates are now device-local (`buzz.channel-templates.v1`,
`features/channel-templates/local.ts`): a name, agent pubkeys, Agents team ids
and a starting Canvas, managed under Settings → Buzz → Channel templates. Picking one in
Create resolves its agents and its teams' members to those that are the owner's
agents in this community and sends them with the Canvas as ordinary channel setup,
which the session applies and retries as before.

Hosted communities (`block.hosted-communities`) is a Block-specific bundled plugin
under Settings → Plugins → Builderlab hosting. It manages Block-hosted relays through a Builderlab
account: browser sign-in, binding the local Buzz identity (a locally signed kind
24243 challenge), and create/archive/unarchive/transfer. A server-declared,
default-off capability also exposes owner deletion for archived communities. The
card persists the bound four-field request before admission. A fresh request can
terminate on a known structured pre-admission code and HTTP status pair;
ambiguous first responses stay pending until an explicit same-UUID delete replay.
Only a tuple-bound non-aborted 202 confirms progress; an aborted 202 ends recovery
without claiming deletion. The card displays valid server quota when available;
without it, Create remains available and the server enforces its owner limit.
`can_create: false` alone disables Create; usage is informational and is never
estimated from visible rows. One origin-wide pending slot is
re-read and verified before dispatch; browser local storage has no atomic compare-and-set,
so exactly simultaneous contexts remain a documented client-side race;
it never signs deletion or infers acceptance from a missing list row. Joining
stays in the existing Join a community dialog; the card only copies the new relay address. Its
account backend follows the same split as `HostService`: live development uses the
broker's `/api/builderlab/*` routes (`browser-host/builderlab.mjs`), which keep the session
credential and signing key in Node. Desktop builds use `native.ts`, the same routes
over the shared `oauth_callback` sign-in, host HTTP to the manifest's single
`https://app.builderlab.xyz` grant, and `identity_sign_builderlab_binding`, which
validates the challenge and signs only the fixed kind 24243 binding. The desktop
credential lives in plugin memory for the plugin's lifetime and is never persisted,
so restarting the app signs out. Other browser builds show the unavailable notice.

### Composer accessories

`ctx.conversation.registerAccessory({ id, title, order?, component })` contributes
read-only contextual UI above the shared composer. The host passes
`{ session, scope, channelId, threadRootId?, canOpen, open }`: no editor commands,
new socket, or implied access grant. Channels supplies target resolution and panel
placement; other composer consumers can omit navigation and return unavailable.
The shared renderer owns deterministic order, error isolation and command
revocation on removal/unmount. Composer destination keys fence session/channel/
thread changes. The accessory remains usable on read-only connections.

Message-placed accessories may opt into `decoratesMessageSummary`. The first
ordered decorator receives the optional `renderMessageSummary(activity?)` hook;
other accessories do not. The host retains reply counts, participant identity,
unread state, and thread navigation. The decorator supplies its activity identities,
inline status content, accessible label and trigger ref, allowing its existing
popover to wrap the host button. It renders the ordinary summary when idle.
When no decorator is registered, or it fails, the host renders the ordinary summary.
This presentation hook grants no additional data or navigation permissions.

Agent Activity is the first consumer. Plugin activation owns its telemetry lease;
multiple composers subscribe to the same session capability. No global selected
channel or activity-specific dependency is added to reusable message components.
The persistent sidebar reads the same session activity snapshot for its quiet marker;
it owns presentation, not capture or an additional activity lease.
This is a host-matched preview addition, not cross-version capability negotiation.

### Channel-header launchers

A panel may additionally contribute `channelLauncher: ComponentType<ChannelLauncherProps>`.
Channels renders these in its conversation header with public `context`, `pressed`,
`available()`, `toggle(target)` and the channel's `canOpen`/`open`. The page owns one selected channel panel, placed
in the bottom drawer by default or the existing companion column when the contribution
sets `channelPlacement: "side"`. With `channelPlacement: "tab"` the launcher instead
opens one tab per channel in the side pane, grouped with thread and other panel tabs;
a new target replaces that tab, and a link tab already open for the target becomes it.
The tab receives `PanelProps.context` too, so it can open or push further tabs. A launcher
selects its **exact active contribution**, not target matching. `available()` and
`toggle()` are revoked when the mounted context or contribution is retired. Optional
`PanelProps.channelContext` carries the current displayed public context to a channel
panel; ordinary link/host panels do not supply it. It is presentation metadata, not
signing authority. Plugins decide when to capture it into their own work.

A tab a link opens is a transient detail: the next link or thread replaces it. A panel
that sets `keepOpen: true` keeps each target it opens from links as its own tab until
the viewer closes it, as a launcher's tab is kept.

Channels keeps layout and channel/thread selection. The Terminal plugin binds its
mounted launcher into the existing shortcut dispatcher, and owns sessions separately
from drawer mounts. No global selected-channel store, extra shortcut listener or
host companion change is required. Disabling/replacing a contribution closes its
drawer, and re-enabling starts closed. See [Terminal](terminal.md) for native support,
session behavior and validation limits. This is a host-matched preview addition,
not cross-version capability negotiation.

### Optional Canvas todos

Todos (`buzz.todos`) is bundled **off by default** in browser and desktop. Enable
it under Settings → Plugins → Manage plugins. Its channel-header ListChecks button opens a right-hand
side panel, grouping items as To do, In progress and Done, with add, a per-item status
selector, check/uncheck, one optional assignee per item, automatic
saving after each action, and explicit Refresh. It uses shared controls and theme
tokens; Channels still owns panel geometry, responsive placement and selection. Terminal remains in the bottom drawer.

The source of truth is ordinary Markdown in one root level-two `Todos` section:

```markdown
## Todos

- [ ] Review the plan
- [/] Build the preview
- [x] Share the preview
```

`[/]` marks Doing, the common Markdown convention for an in-progress task;
ordinary Markdown renders it as plain text. Canvases without it keep their
existing meaning: `[ ]` is To do and `[x]`/`[X]` is Done.

Unordered checkbox items in that section are shown, including nested tasks. Nested tasks remain under their root task’s status group, with collapsible subtrees.
Quotes and fenced examples are not tasks in this view. Doing and checkbox edits
change one source byte; additions insert below the heading without rewriting other
content.
Duplicate Todos sections block editing until corrected in Canvas. Disabling removes
the convenience UI, not the saved list: Channel actions → View canvas remains editable.

An optional terminal suffix records assignment as ordinary Markdown:
` · Assignee: [Display name](nostr:npub…)`, using a full valid npub, not the abbreviated
placeholder shown here. Only that exact structural suffix is assignment metadata;
other links/prose remain task text. The public key is identity; names are escaped
presentation. Assign/change/clear edits only the suffix. The selector uses the
current channel member roster, including that boundary for shared naming policy,
with public-key qualifiers in the opened choices. Missing rosters disable assignment controls; failed profile reads retain key/name fallbacks
and offer retry. Profile renames never rewrite saved Canvas. Former members remain
visible and can be changed or cleared. Assignment sends no notification and grants
no channel membership or access.

Canvas reads occur on open and explicit Refresh, not on a timer. Missing assignee
and member profiles use the existing shared background directory. Typing an unfinished
new item stays local; Add, checkbox and assignment actions save automatically.
Task actions pause while saving; the new-item input stays editable and retains
its text when the save finishes. If the loaded Canvas was written in the current second,
a single cancellable wait respects its timestamp ordering; there is no background
retry loop. Failures and recovered drafts expose Retry rather than silently publishing
on reopen. Save uses the existing session Canvas/outbox contract, including its
24 KiB limit, fresh membership check, writer-backed Canvas head/editor-confirmation
reads and exact signed-event recovery. Canvas reads default to strong consistency
for editor/Todos bases and setup preconditions. Setup delivery and its separate
exact-ID confirmation both use writer-backed reads; unknown seed outcomes are
checked without automatically replaying the seed. Template copies explicitly opt
out and remain replica-eligible; Channel Settings no longer reads a Canvas preview.
Editor/Todos saves carry `expected-revision=<loaded
head id>` (or `none` when absent); template seeds carry `none`. On relays supporting
Canvas compare-and-swap, stale preconditions are refused atomically before mutation.
A proven conflict keeps the local draft and dismisses only that rejected outbox
operation so a reviewed save can proceed. Unknown outcomes remain in Outbox and
block replacement; exact signed retries keep their original precondition. The
post-write different-head check remains conservative and also retains the draft.

**Compatibility gate:** deploy with a relay supporting Canvas revision preconditions
([block/buzz#6780](https://github.com/block/buzz/pull/6780)) for atomic protection.
An older relay may ignore the tag; strong reads and client head comparison alone
cannot prevent concurrent overwrite. The client does not upgrade the relay.
Detected conflicts require reviewing the saved Canvas. Refresh confirms before discarding
edits. Local recovery drafts are partitioned by community/viewer/channel; if browser
storage is unavailable they survive only while the editor stays open. Save never
promotes local recovery storage to shared state. Already accepted outbox operations
remain session-owned if the drawer closes or plugin is disabled.

**Canvas history:** Channel actions → View canvas → History lazily reads retained
kind-40100 revisions in pages of 25, ordered by `created_at DESC, id ASC` with
`until`/`before_id` keyset cursors. The first page is writer-backed so a just-restored
revision is visible; older pages remain replica-eligible. The current marker uses
the editor's strong-read head, not list position. Refresh history rechecks the
head without replacing the editor draft. Author labels use the shared profile
directory, with public-key fallbacks; previews are read-only Markdown source.

Restore requires explicit confirmation and publishes the selected content as a
new signed revision through the existing Canvas save/outbox owner. Its precondition
is the displayed head, never the historical revision or a silently substituted
newer head. Clean editors adopt the confirmed result. Edited or stale recovered
drafts keep their content and original base until explicit reload; browsing and
cancelling never replace drafts. Restore inherits Save's delivery confirmation,
which may automatically replay the exact signed event with its original
`expected-revision`. It never creates a fresh event or substitutes a newer
precondition to retry. If confirmation ultimately fails or remains uncertain,
the dialog retains drafts and shows the error without starting another restore.
Empty revisions can be restored; revisions exceeding the existing 24 KiB save
limit remain previewable but cannot be restored here. No diff viewer or new
delivery owner is introduced.

### Top-bar launchers and the companion slot

A panel may supply `launcher: { icon, target }`. The host renders the decorative
image (generic icon on failure) and uses the panel title as the button label.
`target` is an opaque string, including an empty default; it is not an agent URI.
Launcher-only panels use `matches: () => false`. Clicking selects that exact active
contribution, bypassing target matching so another plugin cannot intercept it.

App owns one launched-panel selection, separate from a page’s local target. The
selection starts closed, repeated clicks toggle it closed, and navigation preserves
open intent. Disable/replacement invalidates the installation object; re-enable
stays closed even at the same key/revision. A stale close cannot dismiss a later
opening, including a later opening of the same contribution. Ordinary close returns
focus to the launcher if available.

Pages explicitly opt in with `companion: true` and receive `{ companion?: ReactNode }`,
a ready-to-render card. They must place it in **every** state, including no relay,
loading and empty data. Channels places its local target above this card in one
right column. Non-opted/legacy pages and Settings use the generic host fallback;
there is never a second simultaneous host dock. The fallback frame stays mounted
while opening/closing to preserve page-local state. `PanelCard` and `PanelFrame`
are ordinary shared components, not another registry.

Only open intent crosses pages: the panel component can remount under a new page,
so this mechanism does not promise persistent agent sessions or drafts. The bundled
Bestie page currently supplies art and truthful not-connected copy, with no send
control, agent API or top-bar launcher. Both browser and Rust native/CLI catalogs
keep it bundled but off by default; saved enabled or disabled flags still win.
Enable it under Settings → Plugins → Manage plugins.

`main.tsx` creates the shared services once; `app/App.tsx` owns startup screens,
navigation, and built-in Settings. `app/services.ts` composes the core services.

Settings and Recovery subscribe directly to plugin management. Page render errors
stay in the page boundary rather than being copied into plugin configuration.

`plugins/manager.ts` is the plugin subsystem's entry point. The app supplies the
Cordis context and bundled manifests/modules. Storage defaults to the platform
adapter, with an optional override for tests. React is provided as `ctx.react`;
external JSX plugins declare `inject = ["react"]` to use the shared instance. The manager
constructs its module loader and execution adapter internally, observes configuration,
and selects the desired plugins (including enabled flags and safe mode).

### Discovery metadata

Plugin manifests may include display-only discovery metadata:

```json
{
  "id": "example.invoices",
  "name": "Invoices",
  "apiVersion": 1,
  "description": "Reconcile invoices without leaving Buzz.",
  "discovery": {
    "category": "productivity",
    "tags": ["Accounting", "Invoice Management"]
  }
}
```

Descriptions contain 1–280 UTF-8 bytes. Category values use the same stable
lowercase identifier syntax as plugin IDs. Tags are readable plain text, such as
`"Programming Language"`, with 1–80 UTF-8 bytes per tag and at most 16 tags. Blank
tags and control characters (including tabs and newlines) are rejected. Duplicate
comparison trims and collapses Unicode whitespace to a single space, then applies
Unicode lowercasing; `"Programming Language"` and `" programming   language "`
are duplicates. The original spelling, casing, and spacing are preserved for
display and serialization. This comparison does not perform Unicode canonical
normalization or full Unicode case folding.
Categories are open slugs: a host may give recognized categories first-class
labels and group unrecognized values under Other, but an unrecognized category
does not invalidate a plugin. Tags carry open-ended search terms. Neither field
grants capabilities, asserts provenance, or describes runtime state. The
`discovery` object accepts unknown display hints for forward compatibility;
security-bearing manifest fields remain strict.

Hosts released before these metadata fields were introduced reject `description`
and `discovery` as unknown manifest keys. Publishers targeting those hosts must
omit both fields; using slug tags does not make them compatible.

### Writing plugin discovery metadata

Choose one primary category by the plugin's purpose. The current Settings
categories are defined in [`src/app/plugin-categories.ts`](../src/app/plugin-categories.ts):

| Category ID | Settings label | Use for |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `communication` | Communication | Composing, reading and navigating conversations. |
| `agents` | Agents | Agent runtimes and configuration. |
| `agent-tools` | Agent tools | Utilities for working with agents and their activity. |
| `developer-tools-and-integrations` | Developer tools & integrations | Developer workflows and connections to other products. |
| `people-and-communities` | People & communities | Profiles, membership and community or relay administration. |
| `productivity` | Productivity | Tasks, reminders and personal work. |

These are host-recognized choices, not a closed manifest enum. Omitted or
unrecognized categories appear under Other. For bundled plugins, the catalog test
requires a non-empty description and a recognized category. External authors can
use other valid slugs, but should use a recognized one when it fits.

Write the description around **what the plugin does**. For example, Voice Notes
uses "Record voice notes and play them in conversations." Name an entry point
only when it is not obvious, using the labels people see in Buzz. Leave the
walkthrough to the README. Avoid feature inventories, implementation details and
repeating an obvious page name just to fill the byte budget.

Use tags for useful topics or search terms that the category and description do
not already explain. Both plain-text terms and slugs are valid; the schema does
not require one naming style. Categories describe purpose; they do not list every
UI surface a plugin touches. Keep `Essentials` and `Core` for host-curated bundled
metadata; external plugins should not use them. This is authoring guidance, not a
manifest validation rule. Discovery tags must not claim permissions, signing,
provenance or runtime health; the host owns those decisions and states.

### Make bundled plugins distinct

Each bundled plugin must be distinguishable from the others at a glance. Choose
a name and description that make its job and scope clear, including who it is
for when that matters. Similar plugins should explain their different jobs in
the catalog itself; people should not need to open both READMEs to tell them
apart. For example, community administration concerns one community's members,
roles and invitations, while relay administration concerns reports, feedback and
communities across a relay for authorized relay staff.

Artwork should reinforce that distinction with a recognizable subject or
silhouette while following Buzz's shared visual style. Avoid giving neighboring
plugins near-identical imagery or relying on color alone to distinguish them.
Before adding or changing a bundled plugin, authors and reviewers must compare
its name, description and artwork with the existing catalog, especially plugins
with similar names or purposes in the same category. Check whether someone new
to Buzz can tell what each adds and which one they need. Revise ambiguous copy
or imagery before considering the plugin ready.

### Writing the plugin README

Keep the user guide short and positive: `# <plugin name>`, a couple of sentences
about what it adds, then one `## Getting started` heading with basic steps. Put
entry points and any required setup in those steps. Focus on using the plugin;
skip default-enabled status and descriptions of what turning it off removes.
For bundled plugins, `src/bundled/readmes.test.ts` enforces this heading structure.
Contributor specifications may follow a `---` separator after the user guide.
Settings still displays that content below the guide; the separator only limits
the heading check in the test.

For example, the bundled Voice Notes guide uses:

```markdown
# Voice Notes

Record a voice note when talking is easier than typing.

## Getting started

1. Choose **Record voice note** (the microphone) in the composer.
2. Choose **Finish voice note** to attach it, then send.
3. Play voice notes in conversations, and change their speed if you like.
```

README packaging and display are separate. Settings displays only READMEs shipped
with Buzz for bundled plugins; it does not display packaged READMEs from external
installations. External authors can still package a README, but should not promise
that it will appear in Settings.

For that bundled renderer, use ordinary Markdown and external HTTPS links.
Credential-free HTTP links are also accepted; relative and in-page links render
as text. Raw HTML is skipped and images render as alt text rather than loading
remote media or data URLs. Put an external build's README beside `manifest.json`
and `plugin.js`; a repository-level README is not automatically included.
The [packaging rules below](#loading-from-folders-and-repositories) cover the
README/icon size limits, reserved filenames and signature coverage.
See the [example authoring walkthrough](../examples/plugins/README.md#add-discovery-metadata-and-a-readme)
for a manifest with these optional fields.

### Declaring host access

Plugins can separately declare host access in `manifest.json`:

```json
{
  "host": {
    "commands": [{ "id": "status", "program": "example-cli", "args": ["status"] }],
    "networkOrigins": ["https://api.example.com"]
  }
}
```

Plugins declaring `host` in `inject` use `ctx.host.runCommand(id, input?)` and
`ctx.host.request({ url, method, headers, body })`. Command calls name a declared
ID; the program and arguments come only from the plugin's manifest. Native
execution uses no shell, accepts no stdin by default, discards stderr, and returns at most 4 KiB of
UTF-8 stdout by default. A command may declare `maxOutputBytes`, an integer from
1 through 1048576 (1 MiB), to request a different bound. Output exceeding that
bound returns `null` without truncation. Existing declarations retain the 4 KiB
default. Hosts that do not support this field reject manifests that declare it.

For example, a plugin querying tools available to an agent may need room for a
JSON inventory containing tool names and descriptions:

```json
{
  "id": "agent-tools",
  "program": "agent-tools",
  "args": ["list", "--json"],
  "maxOutputBytes": 65536
}
```

This is a command entry inside `host.commands`. The plugin parses the inventory;
the host only enforces the declared byte limit.

The direct command invocation has a five-second deadline;
commands may declare `maxInputBytes` (1–65536) for optional UTF-8 stdin data.
Undeclared or oversized input is rejected before spawning. Input never changes
the installed program or arguments, and its delivery shares the existing deadline.
cancellation or timeout kills its process group on Unix or its job process tree
on Windows. Failure returns `null`. The app
also searches standard Homebrew binary directories when a macOS GUI launch has a
limited PATH and passes that search path to the command.
Plugins parse and retain their own credentials; the host has no provider registry
or credential store.

A plugin that needs a long-lived program, such as an agent CLI that speaks a
JSON protocol on stdin and stdout, declares it under `host.processes`:

```json
{
  "host": {
    "processes": [
      { "id": "agent", "program": "example-agent" },
      { "id": "install", "program": "bash", "args": ["-c", "curl -fsSL https://example.com/install.sh | bash"] }
    ]
  }
}
```

`ctx.host.spawn(id, { args, cwd, env, agent, onStdout, onStderr })` starts it
with the caller's `args` after the declared ones, so the declaration names the
program but not every argument. It returns `{ write, end, kill, exited }`.
stdout and stderr arrive as UTF-8 text as they are read, not split into lines.
`cwd` is absolute or `~/…` and is created if missing. `env` adds to the app's
environment (`null` removes a variable); variables starting `BUZZ_` or `NOSTR_`
are never inherited. The program is found on the same search path as commands,
which on macOS also includes `~/.local/bin`. A process declared with
`"bundled": true` instead runs the copy the app ships in its `bin` resources and
never searches PATH; the Goose plugin runs `goose-acp` this way.

`agent` names an agent whose type the calling plugin registered. The
process then runs as that agent, as harness agents do: native puts its key in
`BUZZ_PRIVATE_KEY` (and `NOSTR_PRIVATE_KEY`), its community in `BUZZ_RELAY_URL`
and its owner attestation in `BUZZ_AUTH_TAG`, and puts the bundled agent tools,
including the `buzz` CLI, first on its PATH. The key never enters the WebView,
but the process can sign any event as the agent; the kind allowlist on
`publish` does not bound it.

A process lives until it exits, the plugin kills it, the plugin unloads, the
page reloads or the app exits. `kill` sends SIGTERM to its process group and
SIGKILL three seconds later; the group is always killed once the process exits,
so descendants do not outlive it. At most 64 processes run at once. Processes
run with the user's full access and no sandbox; the import preview says so.

A plugin that declares `"files": true` under `host` reads files and resolves
directories natively, the same on every platform, rather than starting a
program such as `base64` or `pwd` that Windows lacks.
`ctx.host.readFile(path, { cwd })` returns the bytes of a file of at most 50 MB;
`path` is absolute, `~/…`, or relative to `cwd`, which is absolute or `~/…`. A
missing file rejects with an error whose message contains "No such file".
`ctx.host.resolveDirectory(path)` returns an absolute or `~/…` directory as an
absolute path without symbolic links, in the platform's ordinary form, and
creates it if missing, as a process's `cwd` is. Both act with the user's full
access; the import preview says so.

Bundled host grants use the effective compiled manifest at revision `bundled` and
require the plugin to be enabled in the native catalog. External grants require the
enabled current artifact and its integrity checks; safe mode pauses external
plugins while enabled bundled plugins remain usable.

Builderlab's effective manifest derives its exact origin from the validated
[`BUZZ_BUILDERLAB_URL` build input](configuration.md#builderlab-url-build-input).
Its source manifest contains no deployment origins; external plugin declarations
remain fixed in their installed artifacts.

Requests use the native HTTPS client, so a plugin can declare an exact
origin without changing the renderer CSP. URLs must use a declared origin; redirects
are not followed and cookies are not forwarded. Requests accept up to 1 MiB of text
body and 8 KiB of headers; responses return status, up to 64 headers totaling
16 KiB (excluding `Set-Cookie`), and up to 16 MiB of UTF-8 body. The full request
defaults to a 30-second deadline; `timeoutMs` may select 1–180000 milliseconds
for long operations such as Apps initialization. Archive uploads have a
180-second deadline. Browser calls cannot use these native operations.
Existing bundled GitHub requests retain their first-party renderer fetch and CSP
entry.

`host.upload` requires both `host.files` and the destination in `host.networkOrigins`.
It sends a multipart archive to that origin and reads one absolute
regular `.tar.gz` file under home, up to 100 MiB. This is local-file access in
addition to ordinary network requests. The archive suffix and path checks are
guardrails for trusted plugins, not a sandbox or a content classification check.

New-install review lists declarations. Update review compares against the installed
revision and leads with added, changed and removed declarations; changed commands and
processes include previous and replacement details. Equivalent default limits and
reordered declarations do not count as changes. Unchanged updates say so explicitly,
and View unchanged declarations opens a separate view inside the same dialog. Back
returns to the summary without acquiring or discarding the prepared update.
Update review names the plugin, keeps the trust warning visible, and avoids nesting
declarations inside an additional disclosure.
The install/update action accepts that displayed version; an enabled update may run
immediately. These declarations help review and catch mistakes. Plugins share the
main WebView and can invoke app commands directly, so the declarations do not
isolate a malicious plugin. Load only trusted plugin code.

### Loading from folders and repositories

Authors can sign a built API v1 plugin with `buzzodz plugin sign DIST_DIRECTORY`
after `buzzodz plugin build`. The command reads the saved Buzz human identity
from the same OS credential slot as the desktop app; it never exports or creates
a key. Use the same OS account and matching debug or release build. Missing or
locked storage fails. It writes `plugin.artifact.json` and
`plugin.signature.json` as the local [NIP-PS](nips/NIP-PS.md) file pair. No relay
or URL is needed. Include both files in the imported folder or Git repository.
Buzz checks the event ID, signature and exact artifact bytes before install and
each load. Unsigned `manifest.json` and `plugin.js` builds remain available for
local development.

A build may also include conventional `README.md`, `icon.png`, and `icon.jpg` files beside
those required files. README content must be UTF-8 and is limited to 256 KiB.
Icons must match their PNG or JPEG filename and have a decodable first image, each at most 1 MiB, no more than 4096 pixels on
either side, and no more than 1,048,576 pixels total. Signing places their exact
content in typed optional release-envelope fields, so the artifact hash and
publisher signature cover them without changing plugin `apiVersion: 1`. Hosts
continue to accept older `{ manifest, code }` artifacts. The catalog exposes only
small content revisions for import/update comparison. `Manager::content` reads the
integrity-checked content on demand; its native command and capability land with
the first details surface that consumes them.
Both icon formats may be packaged together and are returned independently; the
client decides which format to prefer.
Header parsing and image decoding use a 16 MiB allocation budget; the underlying
decoder may discard optional metadata that exceeds that budget. Validation does
not certify later animation frames or reject trailing bytes after the image.
Content reads return the stored base64 icon strings. Conventional
asset filenames are case-sensitive in both folder and Git imports; a symbolic
link at one of those filenames rejects an unsigned candidate.

`README.md`, `icon.png`, and `icon.jpg` are reserved names in an unsigned build
folder, with the same all-or-nothing rule as `manifest.json`: a file at one of
those names that misses the limits above rejects the whole folder or Git import,
reload, and signing, and an installed plugin keeps its current revision.
Older hosts ignored these names, so a source tree that already ships a
nonconforming file there (for example, a 2048×2048 `icon.png`) stops reloading
after upgrade. To migrate, resize the file to meet the limits, or rename or move it
out of the build folder. Signed artifacts carry their content explicitly and are
not affected by neighboring files.

Older hosts can still read asset-free packages and registry entries. Packages
with these new fields, and registry entries recording their content revisions,
require a host that supports them; older hosts reject unknown fields and may
offer settings recovery. Downgrading after installing such a package is not
supported. This does not change the plugin runtime API version.
Signing requires regular, non-symlink source files, using the same directory
capability boundary as folder import.

These files are publisher-supplied presentation content, not an endorsement or a
runtime asset directory. Buzz-owned framing and fallback artwork remain
authoritative. Any surface that renders packaged READMEs must keep raw HTML and
scripts disabled and must not load embedded data URLs or passive remote media; the
bundled README renderer already follows these rules. The package API does not
turn README links, images, or the icon into plugin runtime resources.

A signed installation can only update from the same publisher; remove and
reinstall to choose a different publisher. Signing identifies an author, but
does not sandbox plugin code or make a publisher trustworthy.

Desktop Settings → Plugins → Manage plugins loads a folder with the native folder picker, or an
HTTPS/SSH Git repository (including GitHub `owner/repository`). An optional branch
or tag is separate from the repository URL; GitHub `tree` URLs are rejected with
guidance rather than ambiguously splitting branch names and subfolders. Discovery
lists built plugin folders by path, name and manifest ID, including nested `dist`
folders. Choose one and explicitly install. An already-installed plugin offers
Open in Buzz, which discards the preview and opens its installed details. Choosing
another source still requires deleting the plugin and adding it again. New plugins
enable by default, with an opt-out in the review footer; successful installation closes the dialog. Updates match
**manifest ID** and preserve the saved enabled state:
an enabled update may activate immediately except in safe mode. Review shows declared host access, including changes. Installed artifacts do
not watch/pull the source. Plugins installed from a folder keep the selected folder
path for automatic checks in Settings → Plugins → Manage plugins. Changed packages
offer Update, which opens access review before explicit confirmation, preserving
the saved enabled state. Settings does not expose the immediate Reload shortcut.
For development, `buzzodz plugin reload ID` explicitly allows replacing an enabled
folder plugin while preserving its enabled state. The running desktop observes the
shared profile catalog every second and disposes the previous revision before
activating the new one. Use the same `--home` and `--profile` as the app. Reloading
identical build bytes does not restart the plugin. CLI reload applies the same
manifest ID and publisher checks as Settings. CLI reload accepts changed host
access and reports the previous and updated declarations. Rejected builds leave
the installed revision unchanged. Replacing an active plugin ends its in-memory
work, including a voice call. This is a host-management capability, since an
external plugin cannot manage other installations or add CLI commands.

Opening an installed plugin's details checks its remembered folder. A matching
package shows Up to date in the pane. Local folders are checked every five seconds
while the pane is open and the app is visible, and again when the app becomes active.
Checks pause during review or pending management operations. Folder checks resolve
the saved source by installed plugin ID and return only a revision or build diagnostic,
without reserving the native import slot. Add can prepare its own preview while a
folder check is pending. Choosing Update acquires a fresh immutable preview; checks
never supply installation bytes. A changed package offers
Update, which opens access review before explicit confirmation. A known update takes
the prominent action position in both the pane and its list row; Enable/Disable
moves into their ellipsis menus while Update is available. The row retains the latest
check result for the installed revision and opens the pane’s review, checking the
saved source again when the pane reopens. Known Git results remain visible on reopen;
Git is checked explicitly through a read-only acquisition that never locks or replaces the shared import preview. Choosing
Update reacquires the Git source with fresh authorization. Only the open pane polls local folders.
The menus also offer Review access, reusing the import review’s disclosures
for the installed manifest, and Delete with confirmation. These menus appear only for
manual/external plugins; bundled plugins keep their Enable/Disable control.
The list row shows no freshness status label. Failed activation shows Retry beside the error for an enabled,
unpaused plugin. Retry activates the installed revision after its previous cleanup
finishes; it does not acquire source files, install a package, or change saved state.
Package freshness and activation failures are displayed separately. Update uses the same source and candidate path; changing sources
requires deleting the plugin and adding it again. Git checks remain explicit in the
pane, using the remembered repository and branch/tag with fresh authorization;
credentials/tokens are never saved with source metadata. SSH accepts explicit URLs
and `user@host:owner/repository.git` shorthand, including organization-specific
usernames. The importer uses the desktop process's inherited `SSH_AUTH_SOCK` and
known hosts, with interactive prompts and SSH config disabled. If normal Git uses
an `IdentityAgent` from SSH config, launch the app with that socket in
`SSH_AUTH_SOCK`; otherwise terminal Git can authenticate while the app cannot. Each check reads metadata from its own temporary clone; only Update retains an
immutable installation preview. The source
follows the current revision through update and rollback. Rollback requires confirmation
in Settings and consumes the previous revision: it cannot toggle forward again. The
enabled/disabled choice is preserved; a later update establishes a new rollback target. Missing sources or changed
plugin identities/paths leave the installation unchanged. Older Git installs and
dropped-folder snapshots without saved source information can use Update to choose
a folder or repository. Only candidates with the installed plugin ID are offered;
confirmation updates in place, preserves the enabled state and retains rollback
history under the normal update rules. The selected source is saved with the new
revision. Git sources remain ineligible for folder Reload.

The Rust manager owns acquisition and immutable preview artifacts, with a bounded
single pending preview per native process. Replacing/closing a preview discards it;
leaving Settings ignores and discards a late result, never automatically installing.
Acquisition is separate from the manager's ten-second management-write timeout.
Installation uses the exact captured bytes and retains the existing artifact hash,
profile locking, rollback, recovery and safe-mode behavior. An uncertain write retains
the preview identity for same-artifact retry; it does not refetch or rebuild.

Local discovery skips symlink directories, `node_modules`, `target` and dot-prefixed
directories such as `.git` and `.claude` (Claude worktrees) below the selected
folder; select such a folder itself to import from it. Git discovery does not skip
dot-prefixed directories. Local discovery uses `cap-std` directory-relative reads to
confine descendant path resolution. Files must be regular and non-symlink;
manifests, modules, READMEs, signatures and candidate folder names must be UTF-8,
while icons are validated as binary PNGs or JPEGs. Folder names are not lossily normalized.
Discovery never evaluates modules. Git is a required local
tool: a shallow no-checkout clone reads committed blobs, without hooks, filters,
submodules, LFS downloads or project scripts. Only HTTPS/SSH are allowed; inherited
Git config, URL rewrites, credential helpers and interactive prompts are disabled.
SSH uses the existing agent/known hosts, not user SSH config; password entry, HTTPS
private-repo sign-in and custom SSH-config aliases are not supported in this slice.
Repository URLs/refs are passed as arguments, not a shell command. Private/internal
HTTPS hosts are not prohibited; this is not a public-network-only policy.

Git acquisition has a 60-second deadline (including blob discovery), an observed
256 MiB repository limit and bounded command output; transport processes are killed
on failure before temporary cleanup. These are polling limits, not hard OS quotas.
Folder traversal checks a 60-second budget between directory reads (a hung filesystem
syscall is not forcibly cancelled), 32 nesting levels and 20,000 entries. A preview
holds at most 32 plugins / 32 MiB; each artifact retains the 8 MiB limit. No builds
are run: source-only folders explain that the author must supply `manifest.json`
plus the self-contained `plugin.js`. Arbitrary assets/TSX/runtime dependency resolution
remain outside API v1. Browser Settings truthfully directs users to desktop rather
than adding a second external-plugin storage or broadening CSP. Native commands need
a rebuilt/restarted desktop process; frontend HMR alone cannot add them.

`plugins/storage.ts` isolates browser storage and desktop IPC. `plugins/modules.ts`
imports and caches executable revisions. `plugins/runtime.ts` adapts Cordis lifetimes
and owns activation status; contribution services receive a read-only readiness view
of that same status. There is no separately synchronized status store.

The runtime receives only the desired plugins. It retains cancellation and cleanup
barriers around asynchronous imports and replacement; Cordis owns dependency
availability and effect disposal. Stopping plugin management stops polling and its
owned plugin lifetimes. App shutdown starts manager disposal and root-context
disposal together: a hung plugin cannot delay cancellation of shared sessions,
requests or subscriptions. The returned promise rejects after 10 seconds if cleanup
has not finished; it does not claim that arbitrary plugin code has stopped. Plugin
replacement still waits for the predecessor's actual cleanup, even after a timeout.
React owns only subscriptions and presentation state.

Catalog polling observes external `buzzodz` writes once per second. Its ten-second
watchdog bounds the caller's wait, not native lock acquisition: one pending catalog
read retains ownership until it actually settles. Retry cannot launch a replacement
while that read is pending. Recovery remains available, but is a separate management
operation and still needs the native registry lock. A timed-out management operation
keeps controls busy until actual settlement; late results are not applied. A fresh
poll reconciles the eventual stored state. Disposal stops polling/publication, not
an already-running native operation.

Relay consumers use `session.channels` for channel views,
`session.profiles` for shared identities, and `session.read` for
finite filtered event reads, and `session.unread` for shared observed badges and
cancellable reading intent. See [relay query ownership](relay-queries.md) and the
[unread capability, durability and limitations](unread.md).

Plugins subscribe to `ctx.relay` connection snapshots and bind work to the current
ready session. `useRelayConnection(relay)` is the React adapter; remount session-owned
views with a key including both scope and generation (for example,
``key={`${connection.scope}:${connection.generation}`}``). Scope distinguishes
retained communities whose generation numbers may match; generation distinguishes
reconnections within one scope. Persist drafts and view intent under scope alone,
not generation. Reactive filtered reads use `session.observe`;
writes use `session.outbox` or the `session.messages` convenience methods. Reads,
live traffic and local events share reconciliation, with no separately injected
write service. Dispose owned views when their plugin or session scope ends.
For kind 30177 publication, follow the
[managed-agent registration guidance](relay-queries.md#managed-agent-registration-kind-30177).

The [Profiles plugin](profiles.md) supplies read-only human/agent identity panels.
Shared message UI opens exact public-key targets through ordinary page callbacks;
no inline-renderer or panel contract extension is needed.

## Navigation targets and visits

The host provides `ctx.navigation` to plugins declaring `navigation` in `inject`.
`open(target)` returns a presentation result, not merely an accepted address:
`opened`, `failed` (with a reason), `superseded`, or `cancelled`. The host owns one
history driver, toolbar/keyboard traversal, and a 15-second attempt deadline.
A visit has stable identity; retrying/reclicking preserves that visit and Forward,
while a new destination truncates the forward branch. Leaving aborts the old
attempt, and late completion cannot acknowledge a replacement attempt.

Version-1 `OpenTarget` accepts legacy Home targets (resolved to Messages), Settings sections, contributed pages with
optional versioned JSON routes, and account/community-bound conversations.
Conversation targets may include `panel: "members"` to restore that channel’s
Members dialog without replacing its channel/message identity. Unknown panel
values are rejected; this is presentation state, never mutation or confirmation state.
The boundary copies, freezes and bounds route data; an address is never an access
grant. Scoped targets require the original viewer and an already joined community.
An explicit `scope: null` restores Personal space; omitted page scope leaves the
current community alone. Unknown providers/routes fail with the target retained
for retry, rather than silently opening another page.

Pages receive optional `navigation` in `PageProps`. Its optional `focus` is
`"content"` by default or `"preserve"` when the opening control keeps focus; page
autofocus must honor it. This is per-opening presentation intent, never route data
or a saved history value. Session binding and default resolution carry it forward;
retry preserves it, while explicit openings and history traversal default to
content focus. The shell topbar passes `open(target, { focus: "preserve" })`
through its page-selection handoff.

Ordinary pages acknowledge a successful mount inside the render boundary.
Pages declaring `handlesNavigation`
acknowledge their domain presentation with `navigation.complete(...)`; Channels
waits for its requested channel window or exact-message reveal/focus. `navigation.resolve(target)` normalizes a
pending default destination within the same visit, caller and original deadline;
it does not start competing navigation. Normalization revokes the old request.

A page request belongs to the exact active registration and mounted host
presentation. Its signal aborts and its callbacks return false after removal,
replacement, unmount or scoped-community invalidation, even before React cleanup.
A reactivated provider receives a fresh request for the still-pending visit.
Session-aware pages bind each rendered connection with
`navigation.forSession(relay, connection)` and pass that request to their
session-owned subtree; Channels demonstrates this boundary. Replacement revokes
the bound request synchronously without revoking static page authority or resetting
the caller's deadline. These are trusted-plugin lifecycle fences, not a sandbox.

`route: { version, validate }` opts a page
into versioned route parameters. These are host-matched preview types through
`@buzz/author`, not a cross-version runtime compatibility promise.

Browser `#buzz=` addresses and session history support reload and Back/Forward.
Messages recognize the Buzz link forms `buzz://channel/<id>`,
`buzz://channel/<id>/<event>` and
`buzz://message?channel=<id>&id=<event>&thread=<optional-root>`. Buzz links carry
no community: they bind to the receiving conversation's community and viewer and
pass through existing navigation admission and session ownership checks. The app
has no link form of its own; any other `buzz://` host is rejected everywhere,
staying plain text in messages. Message targets open their
verified thread, reveal the exact message after bounded history loading, and only
then acknowledge navigation. Supplied root hints do not override verified events.
Missing or unavailable messages report failure. Ingress adapters must reuse this
validated target/completion lifecycle; notification clicks
([notifications](notifications.md)) and OS-delivered deep links on desktop
([OS deep links](deep-links.md)) do. The OS ingress accepts only the Buzz link
forms and binds them to the selected community; any other OS link fails
`invalid-target` through the same failure notice rather than being dropped.

Drafts, reading geometry and sidebar view intent remain domain-owned, outside
visit history. Saved sidebar preferences live in the relay session, not in the
mounted page; see [sidebar ownership](channels.md#ownership).

## Conversation contributions

`registerMessage({ id, title, matches, ownsAttachment?, component })` contributes an optional whole
message body. Components receive `{ message: ChannelMessage, canOpen, open }`; the first active
match wins, throwing matchers are skipped, and render failure/removal restores the
host body. Registration uses the same owned contribution lifetime as inline/link
renderers. The host retains author/time chrome, actions, attachments and session
ownership. `ownsAttachment(message, attachment)` lets the component claim the
attachments it draws itself: the host leaves those out of its list, keeps the
others, and lists every one again if the component fails. Claims count only
while the host draws that component; attachment-only and session-card-only
messages skip it, so their attachments stay listed. A throwing claim is false. `MessageRenderer` is a host-matched author-preview type, not event
admission or cross-version capability negotiation.

`registerMessageAction({ id, title, icon?, matches, component, marker? })` adds an
entry to a message's ⋯ menu. `matches(message, session)` decides per row whether
the entry appears; throwing matchers are skipped. `icon` renders beside the title.
Choosing the entry mounts `component` with `{ message, session, close, canOpen, open }` inside the
row, typically a dialog; it stays mounted until it calls `close()`. The optional
`marker` receives `{ message, session }` and renders beside the timestamp, such as a
state mark. It renders only while `matches` passes, so hiding the menu entry also
hides its mark. The host owns the menu, focus restoration and row lifetime: a row
with an open action stays mounted while it scrolls out of view. Icon, component
and marker failures each render nothing and leave the row and menu usable. The
bundled Reminders plugin is the first consumer.

The bundled **Diff viewer** (`buzz.diffs`) handles `ChannelMessage.diff` from legacy
kind 40008. Shared history, live, thread and exact readers retain these messages
independently of the plugin, preserving raw patches rather than interpreting them
as Markdown images or links. The plugin supplies an inline preview and expanded
Unified/Split dialog. Disabled/failed rendering, malformed/incomplete patches and
patches over the display parsing budget retain escaped raw text. Unconsumed
patch lines and unsupported binary payloads also fall back to the complete raw
patch; metadata-only rename/mode/binary summaries retain rich presentation.
Preview, file and raw scroll regions support native keyboard navigation. Diff
messages are not editable, including through the composer's Up-arrow shortcut.
Diff search remains deferred: the client accepts kind 40008 hits, but relays
whose search index allowlist excludes that kind cannot return them. Metadata is
untrusted presentation, not repository access authority. No sending, applying,
repository fetching or sidebar panels are added.

`registerLink({ id, title, matches, order?, className?, component })` contributes
optional presentation for links already recognized by messages. The host retains
the anchor, destination, new-tab/modifier behavior and panel activation. Components
receive `{ url }` and render non-interactive inline content inside that anchor.
They must not nest links or buttons. Among matching renderers the lowest `order`
wins under the panel [resolution order](#resolution-order); throwing matchers are
skipped. A render failure or plugin removal restores the ordinary link, including
its styling. Registration follows the existing plugin lifetime.

The bundled Links plugin uses blue text, a blue fill only on hover, 2px padding
4px corners, and service icons for GitHub, Google Drive, Figma, Notion, Slack,
Dropbox, OneDrive, GitLab, YouTube, Loom, Zoom and Teams. Google Docs, Sheets and
Slides use distinct file-type icons; unknown websites use a globe. Host matching
does not fetch metadata or infer a service from names in paths or query strings.
Its `order` is a function: recognised services and Buzz entities claim the default
band, the globe case the catch-all band, so a renderer dedicated to one website
wins it at the default.
It does not fetch titles. Messages currently recognize
credential-free HTTP(S) and supported Buzz links. Markdown labels preserve their
formatting, escaped pasted wrappers are normalized outside code, and paired `<…>`
autolink wrappers are hidden in display. Buzz links use known channel names with corresponding icons, falling back
to Channel, Message or Thread when that name is unavailable in the current community;
the full destination remains on the anchor. Buzz activation stays inside the host,
including modifier/middle clicks, even when the optional Links plugin is disabled.
Unsupported Buzz formats remain plain text. The host-matched author preview exports `LinkRenderer`; older hosts do not
provide `registerLink`.

Message hover/focus previews are host-owned. The entire card is a keyboard-accessible
link to the same destination, routed through the same host navigation handler. Opening a preview allocates the current
session's bounded thread reader; closing disposes it. The reader supplies verified
message content, author and timestamp and preserves edit/deletion/access handling.
Previewing never acknowledges reading or switches community. The host offers a
resolved label to the bundled presentation via `LinkLabelContext`; no author API
contract or relay protocol changes are required. Known channel references and
unambiguous signed person/agent mentions share the inline hover styling. Names in
ordinary prose never create notification intent or establish an identity.

`registerCodeBlock({ id, title, matches, component, action? })` contributes optional
presentation for a fenced code block. `matches(language)` receives the fence's
info-string language as written; `component` and `action` receive `{ code, language }`. The
host retains the code frame and its copy action, which copies the source; it
places the optional `action` control, such as an expand button, before copy. A
text selection spanning the block also copies its fenced source, not the
presentation.
Matching uses the same resolution as links without an `order`; throwing matchers
are skipped. A render failure or plugin removal restores the plain block, and
noninteractive previews always show the plain block. The bundled **Mermaid
diagrams** plugin (`buzz.mermaid`) draws `mermaid` blocks with
[Pele](https://pele.run), loaded on first use. Diagrams are untrusted content: Pele escapes
their text and the plugin disables diagram links, images and Pele's own zoom
controls. Its action opens the diagram in an expanded dialog, which zooms by
pinch, Ctrl/⌘-scroll, drag, double-click and keyboard and offers Copy code.
Invalid source shows Pele's error with the source.

The conversation preview exposes top-level `registerTool`, `registerCompletion` and `registerInline`
methods and stable `conversation.ui.Composer` / `.Message` / `.Thread` components, plus `.Tabs` while a plugin provides it. Generated
type-only `@buzz/author` declarations are exercised by a source-only external consumer
fixture in `tests/fixtures/conversation-consumer`; it is built and installed only in
the browser test's temporary profile.
`conversation.format` returns the host's date labels, so plugin text reads like
the message list: `itemTimestamp(seconds, { withTime })` for bylines ("9:05 AM",
"Yesterday at 9:05 AM"), `dayGroupLabel(seconds)` for day dividers ("Today",
"Monday"), `fullTimestamp(seconds)` for the full hover date, and
`relativeTimestamp(seconds)` for link previews ("5 minutes ago"). They use the
current locale and time zone; all but `fullTimestamp` take an optional `now`
for tests. They compute the label when called. `conversation.ui.Message` and
the host's day dividers re-render at local midnight; a plugin that shows these
labels in its own long-lived view must call them again when the day changes.
This remains a host-matched preview, not a stable cross-version SDK. Shared session
ownership and trusted-plugin authority do not change.

`conversation.ui.Thread({ session, scope, channelId, channelName, messageId })`
renders the existing `ThreadPanel` without its side-panel header, close control
or Escape dismissal; the page owns the surrounding header and placement. The
host supplies the rest of the Channels thread behavior: contribution renderers,
message management (edit, delete, mark read/unread, and a notice above the
thread to retry or discard a failed edit or deletion), session-channel
recipients, Buzz link navigation, and one modal at a time for a registered panel
or media review. The page passes its current ready session and stable
community/viewer scope; retargeting disposes the old thread and its modal. As in
Channels, showing a thread is one visit to its channel for unread state, and
that visit lasts across threads of the same channel. The page holds no second
message reader, cache or outbox.
Exact message links still navigate to Channels rather than the page's route.

`conversation.ui.Tabs({ id, session, scope, label, icon, children })` makes the
page's content the first main tab of the host's conversation tab workspace.
`children(open, close, isOpen)` renders that tab; `open({ channelId, threadId?, messageId? }, { keep? })`
shows a joined conversation in a host tab and returns false for any other. A
thread opened with `messageId` reveals that message and keeps it in view. A
thread opens as a side-pane thread tab and a whole conversation as a side-pane
conversation tab, each with the same reader and composer as Channels tabs, so
the page stays in view; any thread can then move to the main pane. A plain open
replaces the tab the previous one added, and `keep: true` adds a tab beside it;
an already-open conversation's tab is selected wherever it is. Each open moves
keyboard focus to the opened tab's composer (a thread's reply box, keeping any
reply target chosen in it) once it can take focus, unless the user clicks or
types first; an open at a message reveals it instead, and a tab restored when
the page remounts takes no focus. `close(target)` closes that conversation's tab, leaving focus to the page unless it opens a tab in the same update, and returns false when none is open; `isOpen(target)` says whether it has one, and a thread opened at a reply keeps its tab once its root resolves. `id` keys the page's tabs, which last for its community session as
Channels tabs do; they keep no Back/Forward visits. Showing a tab enters its
channel visit, as in Channels; `visits: false` leaves reading to the page, as
Inbox does.
The tab workspace belongs to Channels, which supplies it with
`conversation.registerTabs(component)`; the conversation service only holds that
slot. `ui.Tabs` is undefined while no enabled plugin provides it, so a page reads
it at render and falls back to its own layout.

`open({ channelId, messageId })` opens the conversation at that message. The
shared `useMessageOpening` reader waits for verified history (cached rows
decide nothing), reads older pages until the message loads (at most 25 pages
of 20 top-level posts) and mounts the list once, at the message; a reply, or a
message it does not find, opens as its thread in the same tab, scrolled to the
message. Each open asks again, even for the same message, but a tab restored
when the page remounts does not jump back to it. With `threadId` too, the
thread tab opens and scrolls to that message, again on each open. `open(target, { markRead: false })` makes a
conversation tab mark nothing read, so a page such as For You can keep the
posts beside the one it opened unread and mark that one itself; threads read
as they do in Channels.

### Composer ownership and mention tools

The standard composer is reusable host UI in `features/messages`, not a mandatory
Composer plugin. Page plugins may compose it through `conversation.ui.Composer`
(or source props), or build their own editor against the shared session. Built-in
Emoji and Mentions use the same `registerTool` contract as optional tool plugins.
No page imports their implementations. Optional numeric
`order` (default zero, lower first; ties by contribution key) keeps visual and
keyboard order stable across asynchronous activation and re-enable. Mentions uses
`-10` to retain its position before default-order tools such as Emoji. The host groups
negative-order tools with selected-recipient avatars, preserving DOM/keyboard order;
this is host layout, not a new plugin contract. Inline identity chips remain in the draft.

Links, channel references, selected mentions and custom emoji render through shared
message components directly in the editable draft. Display tokens retain the exact authored source;
copying and sending preserve that source. Arrow keys and deletion open adjacent
links for ordinary text editing. Partially deleting a link keeps it plain during
the editing session; double-click selects the link and triple-click selects its
whole paragraph. The host owns source offsets, plain-text paste, composition, undo and
selected recipient metadata. Token renderers are display-only while editing.
Names pasted as text never create notification intent.

Tools receive `insertText`, `insertMention({ pubkey, name })`,
`insertMentions([{ pubkey, name }, …])`, `replaceRecipients`, `insertResource` and `focus` commands,
and read-only `recipients`: the draft's selected mentions as `{ pubkey, name }` in
draft order, so a tool can act for whoever the draft addresses. There is one entry
per mention, so a person mentioned twice appears twice. Recipients the host adds
at send time, such as a Solo channel's sole agent, are not included. The array
keeps its identity until the recipients change.
Mention insertion atomically records visible text and exact notification intent;
`true` means the edit was accepted, **not** that membership or delivery succeeded.
The host serializes successive commands using the latest draft and selection,
enforces text/recipient limits, and revokes commands on tool removal/replacement,
editor destination/session change, disabled/read-only state and unmount. Names are
presentation, never recipient resolution. Editing/pasting over an identity span
removes its intent under the existing draft rules.
The batch command inserts several recipients, such as a team record's agents, as
individual recipients in one undoable edit. It deduplicates batch keys and rejects the whole edit if any recipient is
ineligible, or the resulting draft exceeds its text or 32-mention limit. While
editing an existing message, both mention commands insert identity references
without changing the original notification recipients.

`replaceRecipients([{ pubkey, name }, …])` changes the recipient set in one undoable transaction, preserving prose, formatting, focus and the mapped selection. Mentions that stay keep their names and positions, including duplicates; new recipients are inserted at the start. An unchanged set does not edit the draft, regardless of order. Removed mentions also remove one following space when present, leaving punctuation unchanged. An empty array clears selected mentions. Automatic replacement does not update recent-mention rankings. It uses the same admission and lifetime checks as insertion and rejects the entire edit for invalid or unavailable recipients or length limits. It returns false while editing a sent message. Plain-text names do not become recipients.

`replaceRecipientsIfEmpty` takes the same selection but rejects the change if the current draft contains non-whitespace text outside selected mention spans. Automatic targeting can use this guarded command when available. A false result must not trigger unrestricted replacement. The host checks the current draft at invocation, so a retained command cannot overwrite recipients after typing begins.

`insertResource({ uri, label })` inserts a host-owned inline reference to plugin
content, such as a repository issue or pull request. The host normalizes the label
(single line, at most 120 code points), requires a navigation-safe URI, and sends
exactly one ordinary Markdown link, `[escaped label](uri)`. No tags, recipients or
access grants are added; the receiving agent sees the link. It returns `true` only
when the draft accepted the atom, otherwise the host's user-facing reason (code,
another link, 32 resources, or message length), which the tool should show in place.
The atom is removed whole, restores without its plugin, and copies as its Markdown.
If later edits or restore would stop it from sending as that link (a preceding `!`,
surrounding backticks, code/link formatting), the host turns it into the ordinary
text that will actually be sent, as it does for broken mention intent.

**User intent outlives the tool that created it.** If the built-in Mentions chooser
is unavailable because activation failed, selected recipients, their inline chips
and avatar removal controls, scoped drafts and pending messages remain available.
Editing or deleting a selected mention removes
its explicit mention intent. Removing an avatar clears that identity's explicit
mention intent without changing the authored text. A Solo chat
still needs a tagged agent to send. The session
still owns roster/profile data, membership checks, signing and publication/retry.
Plugins remain trusted same-process code; revocable editor commands do not sandbox the session capabilities they receive.

This preview is host-matched: a tool using `insertMention` needs a host providing
that command. The generated type-only `@buzz/author` package and `apiVersion: 1`
are not runtime capability negotiation or cross-version compatibility promises.

### Composer completion providers

Emoji, Mentions and Channels each register a separate `registerCompletion` contribution.
The host observes focused, enabled textarea text and collapsed UTF-16 selection,
then chooses the valid syntax match closest to the caret (greatest range start),
with `order` and contribution key breaking ties. This lets a later emoji trigger
win over an earlier multi-word mention query. Matchers
must not depend on asynchronously arriving session data: the winning component owns
reactive roster/profile/catalog filtering. Only that component mounts. An empty
result without status/retry hides the menu while keeping the provider subscribed.
Before the first publication the menu is also hidden: syntax matching is not evidence
of loading. Providers must publish an explicit status for actual pending work. Escape
still revokes unpublished work, without exposing ARIA controls for a missing listbox.

Providers receive immutable observation/range evidence and `publish(result)`—not
DOM, focus or replacement commands. Results contain stable IDs, labels, optional
detail/decorative previews and either text, an exact `{ pubkey, name }` mention,
or a `mentions` array of up to 32 such recipients. Batch edit primitives are
copied and frozen before display, and accepted as a single editor transaction.
The host copies edit/query primitives and caps publications at 50 choices. A
publication returns its own withdrawal disposer (or `false` after revocation).
Providers must withdraw synchronously when the data supporting a displayed choice
changes, and republish from the new snapshot; unrelated notifications must not
leave a withdrawn result without pending work. Cleanup cancels asynchronous work.

The host binds callbacks to the exact contribution, editor revision and query.
Edits (including same-text input), selection changes, blur, composition, disabled
state, plugin replacement, destination/session change and unmount revoke old work.
Acceptance rechecks the actual DOM text/caret/focus and atomically replaces the
query through the existing mention-draft path, retaining its text/recipient limits.
Typing/pasting a name alone never creates notification authority. Accepted mention
intent survives optional plugin removal and remains subject to session validation.

One host-owned, viewport-bounded portal renders the active listbox. Focus stays on
the textarea with `aria-controls`/`aria-activedescendant`; arrows follow stable IDs,
plain Enter/forward Tab accept, and Escape dismisses pending results. A typed
terminator accepts the provider-verified unique exact match: plain Space for a
mention, the closing colon for an emoji shortcode. Emoji publishes an exact-match ID
only after both Unicode and community catalogs successfully settle. The editor refuses
typed terminators in rich or raw Markdown literal ranges; colon conversion records the
typed source first so undo restores the closing colon and collapsed caret. A rejected
displayed choice must not fall through to sending. Retry is a selectable menu action
using the same arrow/Enter/Tab path, including when there are no results. Modified
keys, Shift+Enter/Shift+Tab and IME events retain ordinary editing behavior.

Emoji lazily copies native-only records (including aliases and keywords) from the
pinned data package; it does not use Emoji Mart's mutable global search singleton.
Community matches come only from the current session catalog. Mentions performs
bounded background enrichment through the shared profile directory, not per-key
network reads or a separate identity cache. Multi-word filtering stays in the
provider so a delayed name can appear without another editor event.

Channels filters the session's joined channel roster locally, including private
channels and joined channels restored from cache (the store marks those
`readOnly` and `cached` until the relay reconfirms them), but excluding DMs,
sessions, archived, hidden, unnamed and other read-only entries. After a 180 ms
typing pause, a query also asks `searchPublic`, through the same
`usePublicChannelSearch` hook as Command-K, for open channels the viewer has not
joined; they are labeled "Not joined", and private results are never offered.
The relay has no name search, so that lookup covers only its newest page of
channel metadata, which the store reuses while the viewer types. While the next
lookup runs, the previous one's still-matching rows stay. Names match by the
channel pickers' rule (`matchName`): exact, prefix, word start, then substring,
with alphabetical ties. Its fuzzy ranks are left out, because Enter and Tab pick
the first row while the viewer writes prose. Open channels follow joined ones, as
in Command-K, so a late search result never moves the first row; when joined
matches would fill the 20 rows, five stay reserved for open channels. Namesakes
include their channel IDs. A query containing a space completes only names it
prefixes, as person names do, so ordinary prose after `#name` closes the popup.
Empty ready results hide the popup. Loading (only while the channel list is
loading), open-channel search and explicit error/retry states stay visible; a
failed open-channel search keeps joined matches and offers a retry. When the
search covered only the newest page and found no open match, a note says so
beside the rows already shown. Selection rechecks current membership (or the
public preview) and name, then inserts an escaped, ID-backed Markdown link
without notification recipients.
The shared editor host checks raw Markdown and rich code/link/literal ranges only
after a Channels syntax match, keeping suggestions in prose (including headings).
Ordinary typing skips that extra context scan. Popup positioning and keyboard/IME
behavior remain host-owned; no new completion API or editor command is introduced.

This is the same host-matched preview as toolbar tools, not version negotiation or
a sandbox. Inline mention pills remain outside this completion implementation.

The optional bundled `buzz.voice-notes` plugin registers a microphone tool and
an attachment renderer. `capture(component)` gives the tool a revocable composer
surface with `accept(recording)` and `cancel()` commands. Disabling the plugin,
hiding the conversation, changing destinations or entering read-only mode stops
unaccepted recording. Accepted recordings belong to the existing attachment draft,
so navigation or plugin removal leaves them available with host fallback controls.

The existing native and browser upload adapters prepare `voice-note-*.wav` files
as the old Buzz H.264/AAC MP4 envelope. Voice Notes adds no uploader, signer or
outbox. Files upload on Send, retain the shared progress/recovery behavior, and
carry bounded duration and waveform metadata through ordinary `imeta` tags.
Recordings stop at five minutes. Pending files have the same tab-local lifetime
and limits as other attachment drafts; they do not survive app restart.

The player loads audio on Play, supports seeking and playback speed, and pauses
when its conversation is hidden. Existing voice notes are recognized from signed
filename metadata even when their Markdown label differs. Notes without waveform
metadata retain a neutral waveform. Disabling the plugin restores ordinary audio
cards. The fixture at `/tests/fixtures/voice-notes.html` exercises the real recorder,
composer and session with disposable local media; browser tests provide its local
media response. Native microphone permissions were exercised in the staging app.

## Desktop browser

Plugins can render the host-provided [`browser.View` component](browser.md) inside a panel. It opens HTTP(S) pages beside the conversation on macOS desktop. The host owns website rendering, navigation controls, and native session cleanup. Remote pages receive no Buzz IPC bridge; plugin JavaScript remains trusted same-process code. The [capability guide](browser.md#try-the-capability-with-a-local-plugin) includes a complete local-plugin example and installation steps.

## Decisions

The host composes one `DecisionsService` in `app/services.ts`. Plugins, bundled
or external, declare `inject = ["decisions"]` and call `ctx.decisions.decide`
to ask typed questions about a piece of text. One provider answers every
question in one call:

```ts
import type { Context } from "@buzz/author";
export const inject = ["decisions"];
export async function apply(ctx: Context) {
  const result = await ctx.decisions.decide({
    state: "The build is broken on main.",
    questions: {
      urgent: { type: "yes_no", instructions: "It needs attention now." },
      topic: {
        type: "choice",
        instructions: "What is it about?",
        options: { build: "CI or builds", other: "Anything else" },
      },
      severity: { type: "score", instructions: "How severe?", levels: ["low", "medium", "high"] },
    },
    timeoutMs: 5_000,
  });
  if (result.outcome === "answered") {
    const urgent = result.answers.urgent; // { type: "yes_no", probability }
  }
}
```

A request has 1 to 32 questions, keyed by an answer name of at most 64
characters. `choice` takes 2 to 255 options (value -> when to pick it); `score`
takes 2 to 10 level labels, lowest first. A `yes_no` answer is a probability;
a `choice` answer is the picked value with its confidence; a `score` answer is
where it falls on the 0-based scale (it can be fractional), with a confidence.
Probabilities are 0 to 1. `timeoutMs` is clamped to 1 to 30 seconds.

`decide` never rejects. It resolves with `{ outcome: "failed", reason }` when
no decision provider is on (`unavailable`), the chosen provider has no
saved key or sign-in (`missing_credentials`), the provider refused it
(`unauthorized`), the questions are malformed (`invalid_request`), the request
is over 128 KiB (`input_limit`), or the call times out, fails, or returns
answers that do not fit the questions. A failed call is not retried and never
falls back to another provider.

### Decision providers

Providers are plugins too. A plugin offers one with
`ctx.decisions.registerProvider`; it is listed under Settings > Decisions API
while the plugin is on, and removed when the plugin stops:

```ts
import type { Context } from "@buzz/author";
export const inject = ["decisions"];
export function apply(ctx: Context) {
  ctx.decisions.registerProvider({
    id: "example",
    label: "Example",
    description: "Use your Example account.",
    status: () => "ready", // or "checking", "unconfirmed", "needs-setup"
    subscribe: (listener) => () => {}, // call listener when status changes
    async decide(request, { signal }) {
      // request is already checked and has its timeoutMs; signal aborts at it.
      return { outcome: "answered", model: "example-1", answers: {} };
    },
    Settings: ({ active }) => null, // shown while this provider is selected
  });
}
```

The host owns everything around the call, so every provider is held to the same
rules: it checks the request against the limits before any provider sees it,
stops waiting at the deadline, turns a throw into `service_error`, and checks
the reply. An answer of the wrong type, an unknown choice, a value outside 0 to
1 or a missing answer makes the call `invalid_response`; answers to questions
that were not asked are dropped.

The user chooses the provider in Settings > Decisions API, and the choice is
kept on this device. Until they choose, TypeSafe (`buzz.typesafe/typesafe`)
answers. Decision text can include private messages, so no other provider gets
it without that choice: while the chosen provider is not on, decisions are
`unavailable` and are not sent to another provider. `ctx.decisions.backend()`
is the answering provider's key (`<plugin id>/<provider id>`), or undefined
when none is on, and `ctx.decisions.status()` its status. `Decisions` exposes
no way to choose the provider. `state` and every question go to the provider,
so send only what the decision needs.

| Provider | Plugin | Credentials |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| `buzz.typesafe/typesafe` | TypeSafe (bundled, on by default) | The user's TypeSafe key, kept and read only by native code (`src-tauri/src/decisions.rs`) |

## In-app keyboard shortcuts

The host composes one `ShortcutsService` in `app/services.ts`. Plugins declare
`inject = ["shortcuts"]` and call `ctx.shortcuts.register(shortcut)`; their bindings
use the same matching/dispatch rules as host-owned Settings and interface sizing.
There is no OS-wide hotkey registration, native accelerator API, or command bus.

```ts
import type { Context, Shortcut } from "@buzz/author";
export const inject = ["shortcuts"];
export function apply(ctx: Context) {
  const shortcut: Shortcut = {
    id: "show-details",
    title: "Show details",
    binding: { key: "k", mod: true, shift: true },
    // Optional Settings presentation order within this plugin's category.
    order: 10,
    when: () => detailsViewIsAvailable(),
    run: () => showDetails(),
  };
  ctx.shortcuts.register(shortcut);
}
```

`binding` is one binding or a nonempty array of aliases. `key` matches the logical
`KeyboardEvent.key` case-insensitively, not a physical `code` (Space is `" "`,
not `"Space"`). `mod` means Command
on Apple platforms and Control elsewhere; Shift/Alt and the other primary modifier
match exactly. IME/AltGraph events and already-prevented events are never consumed.
The window listener runs in the bubbling phase, after local editor handlers.

By default bindings do not run in editable targets (including open Shadow DOM),
while a dialog is open, or repeatedly on a held key. Explicit `allowInEditable`,
`allowInModal` and `repeat` opt in; `when` checks current eligibility without
re-registering. `run` may return a promise; throws/rejections are logged and isolated.
Only a selected binding prevents the browser default. An eligible held binding
still prevents the default when its repeat handler is suppressed.

IDs are namespaced by installation. Only active revisions participate; disable,
failed activation, replacement and Cordis disposal remove eligibility. Plugin ties
are resolved by ascending namespaced ID, independent of activation order. Host
bindings are reserved even while unavailable (Settings does not navigate behind a
modal). `snapshot`/`subscribe` expose ready plugin registrations, not host bindings
or a promise that every binding wins every current focus conflict. The host-only
registration method is deliberately absent from the injected type contract; plugins
remain trusted same-process code, not sandboxed adversaries.

`order` is optional and defaults to `0`. It controls only the row order in Settings
within this owner's category; lower values appear first. Every bundled plugin
assigns deliberate values to its actions (for example, a primary action starts
at `10`), leaving gaps for related actions to be added later. Equal orders use
the stable namespaced contribution key (`pluginId/shortcutId`), then title, as
presentation tie-breakers. The core Buzz host category uses the same metadata
and a host-owned functional sequence: navigation, interface sizing, search/settings,
then development-only actions. Host rows use their bare IDs for tie-breaking.
Presentation order does not affect dispatch precedence, and
shortcuts with duplicate titles remain separate rows because registry keys—not
titles—identify bindings and their overrides.

See [`shortcut-counter`](../examples/plugins/shortcut-counter/README.md) for a
self-contained external plugin using the real service without a DOM listener.
The generated type-only `@buzz/author` exports `Shortcuts`, `Shortcut`, `KeyBinding`
and `RegisteredShortcut`. This is a host-matched preview: older hosts without the
`shortcuts` capability cannot activate such a plugin. `apiVersion: 1` alone is not
runtime feature negotiation. Multi-key chord sequences and command palettes are
outside this initial contract.

Users can rebind any registered shortcut in Settings → Shortcuts without plugin
changes. The page lists host bindings and every active plugin contribution from the
dispatcher's own `hostSnapshot`/`snapshot` registries, grouped by owner, so it
cannot drift from what fires. Overrides live in the host-owned device-local
`buzz-shortcut-bindings.v1` preference, keyed by the registry identity the
dispatcher already uses: the bare id for host bindings and `pluginId/id` for plugin
contributions. The dispatcher resolves the effective binding at match time, so a
plugin keeps registering its default and never sees, stores or re-registers for
an override; the override follows the plugin across disable, re-enable and
replacement, and an override whose owner is no longer installed is ignored rather
than deleted. Rebinding replaces an alias set with the single chosen chord; reset
restores every alias. On Apple platforms a binding may add Control (`ctrl`) beside
Command, as in ⌃⌘A Archive chat; elsewhere Control is `mod`, so a `ctrl`
binding never matches there and capture never records one. Host chords stay reserved: the page refuses to assign a chord
that another listed shortcut already uses, host or plugin, refuses the copy, cut,
paste and select-all chords (and close-window/quit in the desktop build) because a
match would prevent their default everywhere, and warns when a chord is one the
message editor handles locally. A conflict can still appear after capture, for
example when a plugin that was disabled at the time is re-enabled with the same
default or a new plugin ships one; the dispatcher then resolves it silently, so
each affected row shows an "Also used by …" line naming the others. A malformed
stored override falls back to the registered default rather than stopping
dispatch. `formatBinding` in
`features/shortcuts/format.ts` renders any `KeyBinding` for the current platform;
plugins that print their own hint (the bundled terminal does) show their registered
default because overrides are host state. Xterm is the intentional local-first
exception: before translating a keydown into PTY input, it synchronously forwards
the original event to this same dispatcher through a private DOM handoff. Eligible
app shortcuts (including live rebinds) win there; unhandled keys stay with xterm.
No plugin shortcut API or preference access is added. Ordinary editors continue
to handle keys before the window's bubbling dispatcher.

Known limitations. Capture and matching both use the logical `KeyboardEvent.key`.
On macOS an Option chord reports the composed character, so Option+K is stored
and shown as `⌥˚`, and Shift+digit chords store the punctuation (`!` rather than
`1`). This is internally consistent, so the binding fires, but it depends on the
active keyboard layout and the displayed chord can differ from the keys pressed.
The intended fix is to match Alt/Option chords on the physical `event.code` in
both the capture control and the dispatcher's `matches`, which is a coordinated
change to the plugin-facing matching rules and is deliberately not part of the
Settings page.
